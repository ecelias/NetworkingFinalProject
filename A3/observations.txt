Our generated graph showed a linear positive correlative relationship between bottleneck bandwidth set and 
measured throughput in TCP and UDP trials. This makes sense in the context of what we understand about TCP transmissions; 
TCP is more useful for file transfer, where accuracy and in-order delivery is more important than speed, and 
increasing the size of the file(s) increases the time it takes to complete. In contrast, the measured throughput 
in UDP trials grew more slowly between trials of increasing bandwidth. This is because UDP facilitates faster, 
less accurate transmitting, which is valuable for activities like streaming, where a few frames missing is unlikely 
to detract significantly from the user experience.
