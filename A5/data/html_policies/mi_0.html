Whenever possible, please do not disclose the verification code you received to anyone (including those who claim to be Xiaomi customer service). Whenever you sign in as a Mi Account user on Xiaomi websites, particularly on somebody else's computer or on public Internet terminals, you should always sign out at the end of your session.</p><p style="text-align: start">Xiaomi cannot be held responsible for lapses in security caused by third party accessing your personal information as a result of your failure to keep your personal information private. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you must notify us immediately if there is any unauthorized use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security. Your assistance will help us protect the privacy of your personal information.</p><h3 style="text-align: start"><strong>4.3 Retention policy</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start">We retain personal information for the period necessary for the purpose of the information collection described in this Privacy Policy, or as required by applicable laws. We will cease to retain and delete or anonymize personal information once the purpose of collection is fulfilled, or after we confirm your request for erasure, or after we terminate the operation of the corresponding service. An exception to this is personal information that we are processing for public interest, scientific, historical research, or statistical purposes.

In order to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure or other similar risks, we have put in place all legally required physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect from you. We will ensure that we safeguard your personal information in accordance with applicable law.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">For example, when you access your Mi Account, you can choose to use our two-step verification program for better security. When you send or receive data from your Xiaomi device to our servers, we make sure they are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) and other algorithms.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">All your personal information is stored on secure servers, and protected in controlled facilities. We classify your information based on importance and sensitivity, and ensure that your personal information has the required level of security. We have special access controls for cloud-based data storage, and we regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against any unauthorized access and use.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">We conduct due diligence on business partners and third party service providers to make sure that they are able to protect your personal information. We also check that appropriate security standards are maintained by these third parties by putting in place appropriate contractual restrictions, and where necessary, carrying out audits and assessments. In addition, our employees and those of our business partners and third party service providers who access your personal information are subject to enforceable contractual obligations of confidentiality.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">We conduct security and privacy protection training courses and tests to enhance our employees' awareness of the importance of protecting personal information. We will take all practicable and legally required steps to safeguard your personal information. However, you should be aware that the use of the Internet is not entirely secure, and for this reason we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of any personal information when transferred from you or to you via the Internet.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">We handle personal data breaches as required by applicable data protection law which includes, where required, notifying the breach to the relevant data protection supervisory authority and data subjects.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>4.2 What you can do</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">You can set a unique password for Xiaomi by not disclosing your sign-in password or account information to anybody (unless such person is duly authorized by you) to avoid password leaks to other websites which may harm your account security at Xiaomi. Whenever possible, please do not disclose the verification code you received to anyone (including those who claim to be Xiaomi customer service). Whenever you sign in as a Mi Account user on Xiaomi websites, particularly on somebody else's computer or on public Internet terminals, you should always sign out at the end of your session.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">Xiaomi cannot be held responsible for lapses in security caused by third party accessing your personal information as a result of your failure to keep your personal information private. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you must notify us immediately if there is any unauthorized use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security. Your assistance will help us protect the privacy of your personal information.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>4.3 Retention policy</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">We retain personal information for the period necessary for the purpose of the information collection described in this Privacy Policy, or as required by applicable laws. We will cease to retain and delete or anonymize personal information once the purpose of collection is fulfilled, or after we confirm your request for erasure, or after we terminate the operation of the corresponding service. An exception to this is personal information that we are processing for public interest, scientific, historical research, or statistical purposes. Xiaomi will continue to retain this type of information for longer than its standard retention period, where permitted based on applicable laws or your request, even if further data processing is not related to the original purpose of collection.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\"></p><h2 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>5 Your rights</strong></h2><h2 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>CONTROLLING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h2><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>5.1 Controlling settings</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">Xiaomi recognizes that privacy concerns differ from person to person. Therefore, we provide examples of ways Xiaomi makes available to you to restrict the collection, use, disclosure or processing of your personal information and control your privacy settings, such as sign in or out of the Mi Account.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for the aforementioned purposes, you may change your mind at any time by writing or emailing us at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://privacy.mi.com/support\">https://privacy.mi.com/support</a>.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>5.2 Your rights to your personal information</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">Depending on applicable laws and regulations, you have the right to access, rectification, and erasure of any other personal information that we hold about you (hereinafter referred to as the request).</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">You may also access and update the details relating to the personal information in your Mi Account at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://account.xiaomi.com\">https://account.xiaomi.com</a> or by logging into your account on your device.

We shall consider the grounds regarding your erasure request and take reasonable steps, including technical measures. <strong>If the right is upheld, we may not be able to immediately remove the information from the backup system due to applicable law and/or technology limitations. If this is the case, we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until the backup can be cleared or be made anonymous.</strong></p></li><li><p>You have the right to object to certain types of processing, and under certain circumstances where the legal basis for processing is our legitimate interests..</p></li></ul><p style=\"text-align: start\">Particularly under the laws of some jurisdictions:</p><ul><li><p>You have the right to obtain from us the restriction of processing your personal information.

If we believe that certain aspects of the request to delete or access the information may result in our inability to legally use the information for the aforementioned anti-fraud and security purposes, it may also be rejected.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>5.3 Withdrawal of consent</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">You may withdraw your consent previously provided to us for a particular purpose by submitting a request, including collecting, using, and/or disclosing your personal information in our possession or control.
