		<h3>Terms and Privacy Policy (“Terms”)</h3>
		<h3>Version: 2.1</h3>
		
		
<p><b>Effective: June 13, 2024</b></p>
<p>FordPass is a platform that empowers you to rethink the way you travel. Through a collection of current features and programs, and features coming soon, FordPass provides you with more options so you can go further than you thought possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ford is continually working to improve and expand the FordPass programs, features and functionality to meet the everchanging needs of our customers. These Terms describe FordPass programs and features currently available as well as features planned for the future. The Terms apply to all of the features described below, but you can check the FordPass website and mobile app to see which features are currently available. Some FordPass features may be available only in the App or on the Site. FordPass may also integrate with other services or devices, and these features may be subject to separate or supplemental terms or privacy practices – these will be presented to you in connection with that feature. Check back often as we add new programs and features to understand how you can get the most out of FordPass!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we get started, we want you to know how FordPass works and we need you to click “Accept” to accept our Terms. Please review carefully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few important points:&nbsp;</p>
<p>·<b>FordPass relies on data from you, your computer or mobile device, and from your vehicle -- such as vehicle location and driving data -- if your vehicle is equipped with connectivity features or technologies and associated to your FordPass account. This is so we can deliver to you great functionality and services, as well as communications tailored to your interests. We may share this information, including with our authorized dealers and affiliates, as described in the FordPass Privacy Policy, which you can read in Section 2 below.</b></p>
<p>· In addition to App updates and things including but not limited to wireless network strength and availability issues, dead batteries, or lost phones, make sure that you can always access your vehicle even if you can’t access FordPass –<i>always take your key or key fob with you, and check your in-vehicle systems if any information in FordPass doesn’t seem right</i>. And only use FordPass when it’s safe to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>· Periodically, we update the App to introduce new features or fix issues. In some cases, you may need to install the newest version of the App before you can use FordPass again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>· Even if you choose the Spanish version of the App, some sections of the App including certain messages regarding vehicle health may be displayed in English. If you have any questions regarding any such message please contact a Ford Guide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>·<b>These Terms contain important disclaimers and other provisions that limit our liability to you.</b></p>

<p>8. FordPass Rewards (Not available in Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands)&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you register with FordPass, you are automatically enrolled in FordPass Rewards. Then, you must activate your account before you can earn Points or Tier Activities (as defined below). FordPass Rewards (“<b>FPR</b>”) is brought to you by Ford and participating Ford and Lincoln dealerships (“<b>Dealers</b>”). Participation in FPR is subject to these terms and conditions of<b>Section 8</b>(collectively, the “<b>FPR Terms</b>”).&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>a. MEMBERSHIP</b></p>
<p>Membership in FPR is open to U.S. residents, excluding residents of U.S. territories, 18 years of age or older, or the age of majority in their place of legal residence, whichever is older. Membership is only open to individuals; companies, groups and organizations cannot be members. You must have a valid email address at the time of enrollment. Your FordPass account email address may only be associated with one FPR member and one membership account (“<b>FPR Account</b>”). Individuals may not have multiple memberships. However, a household may have more than one membership. Individuals who have the same permanent address are members of the same household (“Household”). Memberships cannot be merged or transferred. You may register an eligible vehicle with your FPR Account. Only vehicles which are owned by a member of your Household may be registered to your FPR Account.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>b. EARNING POINTS</b></p>
<p>FPR allows Members to earn FordPass Rewards Points (“<b>Points”</b>)<b>.</b>To earn Points or achieve Tier Activities (as defined below), you must have activated your account and have an active &nbsp;valid FPR membership within 60 days after any FPR activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Points can be earned through multiple different activities, (“<b>Qualifying Point Activities</b>”), including the purchase of Ford, Motorcraft, or Omnicraft parts, and any associated labor from a Participating Dealer, as well as through use of FordPass and other Ford-related activities. If a Member uses Points to discount the price of a product or service (including but not limited to Recurring Payments), the Member will only earn Points for the net discounted price paid in cash. Points will not be awarded for paid taxes, fees, or shipping. Click<a href="https://www.ford.com/support/how-tos/fordpass/fordpass-rewards/">here</a>for more information about earning Points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Members can also&nbsp; achieve Tier levels through a variety of Qualifying Tier Activities (“<b>Qualifying Tier Activities</b>”). Click<a href="https://www.ford.com/support/how-tos/fordpass/fordpass-rewards/">here</a>for more information about Tier levels and Qualifying Tier Activities. Qualifying Point Activities and Qualifying Tier&nbsp; Activities are collectively referred to as Qualifying Activities (“<b>Qualifying Activities</b>”).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some cases, a Member may earn both Points and earn activities toward Tier elevation for the same Qualifying Activities. However, some activities may only earn Points and others may only be designated as a Qualifying Tier Activity. FPR may provide bonus Point earning opportunities and Tier Activities to select members at the sole discretion of Ford.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Points will typically be deposited into an FPR Account within 10 days of confirmation of completing all of the requirements of a Qualifying Activity, and Qualifying Tier Activities will typically be reflected within 60 days of confirmation of completing all of the requirements of a Qualifying Activity. A qualifying vehicle purchase may take at least sixty (60) days to be deposited or reflected. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain Qualifying Activities may require additional time to validate, therefore you should allow additional time for Points and Qualifying Tier Activities to be deposited into or reflected in your FPR Account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Points and Qualifying Tier Activities are not transferrable.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>c. MEMBERSHIP TIERS</b></p>
<p>FPR has three Membership Tiers (“<b>Tier(s)</b>”): Bronze, Silver and Blue. Bronze is the entry level Tier. Silver and Blue Tiers may be achieved in a calendar year (“<b>Qualification Year</b>”) by completing Qualifying Tier Activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tier status begins when Qualifying Tier Activities are reflected to your FPR Account based on your Qualification Year activity. You must earn a minimum number of Qualifying Tier Activities (“<b>Qualifying Threshold”</b>) during the Qualification Year to attain or renew Silver or Blue Tier status.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Silver or Blue Tier status is retained for the remainder of the year in which the Qualifying Activity took place, plus the next full calendar year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>d. REDEEMING POINTS</b></p>
<p>FordPass Rewards Points can be redeemed for various items and services from Ford; for discounts on the purchase of a vehicle, service, parts or accessories at<i>any</i><a href="https://www.ford.com/support/fordpass/fordpass-rewards/participating-dealers/">participating Dealer</a>and online at <a href="https://accessories.ford.com/">Accessories.Ford.com</a> or <a href="http://fordparts.com/">FordParts.com</a>; for eligible subscriptions or Recurring Payments; or for any other rewards as determined by Ford (collectively, “<b>Rewards</b>”).

<p>Once redeemed, Points cannot be refunded or returned to you, unless otherwise indicated when redeemed. If returns or refunds are permissible, the return or refund will be governed by the relevant return or refund policy. When you use your Points to pay for a Recurring Payment, you may be eligible to receive a refund of the Points you used towards the Recurring Payment, if the terms for the Recurring Payment provide for a refund. When you use your Points to pay for a Recurring Payment that is non-refundable, you will not be eligible for a refund of your Points.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>e. POINTS VALUE</b></p>
<p>FordPass Rewards Points do not have any cash value. Points are only a measurement of your activities in FPR and are not considered your property.
