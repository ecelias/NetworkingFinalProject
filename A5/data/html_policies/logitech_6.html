<div class="blockQuote">At our discretion, we reserve the right to decline your offer and cancel your order.

<h2 class="blockQuote">Section 6: Payment Terms</h2>
<div class="blockQuote">You agree to pay for the product through the payment methods offered on this Site. Those payment methods may be subject to their own terms and conditions. We may use third-party service providers to process and authorize your payment.

You further agree that we may charge the total amount of the purchase—including any applicable taxes, delivery, and customs charges—to your designated payment method. If we have delivered your product or service to you and your payment method fails for any reason, you agree to pay us the full amount due upon demand.</div>


<h2 class="blockQuote">Section 7: Export</h2>
<div class="blockQuote">The products and services sold on this Site are subject to the import, export, and re-export laws and regulations of the United States and other countries. By completing a sale on the Site, you agree to comply with these import and export laws and regulations, including laws and regulations that place restrictions on the destinations, user, and end use of the products and services. You agree that you will not purchase or use any products or services offered for sale on this Site if any applicable laws in your country prohibit you from doing so. Accessing or using any products or services sold on this site in a location where their use is illegal is strictly prohibited.</div>
<div class="blockQuote">No party that is designated on the U.S. Treasury Department’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (“SDN List”), available at <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/sdn-list/pages/default.aspx">https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/sdn-list/pages/default.aspx</a>, has or shall have any property interest whatsoever in the products purchased on this site. </div>
<div class="blockQuote">By completing a sale on the Site, you warrant that you are not on and are not 50% or more owned by one or more persons or companies identified on the SDN List. You further warrant that you are not acting on behalf of and will not divert any products purchased on this Site to (1) any restricted party identified by the U.S. Government; (2) any party blocked by operation of law; or (3) any prohibited end-use or destination as set forth in the U.S. Export Administration Regulations.  </div>


<h2 class="blockQuote">Section 8: Customs and Import Costs</h2>
<div class="blockQuote">Your purchase of a physical product may be subject to customs tariffs, duties, fees, taxes, and/or other charges that may be payable in the destination country (“Import Costs”). Unless expressly stated by us during the ordering process, your payment for your order does not include these Import Costs. You agree that you, as the receiving party in the product’s destination country, are responsible for getting the products or services into the country you intend to use it, properly declaring the merchandise to the appropriate customs authorities, paying applicable Import Costs, and satisfying any additional import-related requirements.</div>
<div class="blockQuote">When completing a sale, you may be given an option to prepay the Import Costs. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to estimate these Import Costs. However, because we do not control them, we cannot predict with 100% accuracy what the final Import Costs will be. You agree that the actual import costs may vary from our estimate.<br>
  <ul class="nonBulletedList">
    <li><strong>If you choose to prepay the Import Costs:</strong> Where the final Import Costs are greater than our estimate, we will not ask you to pay additional money, and where the final Import Costs are less than our estimate, we will not refund the difference.</li>
    <li><strong>If you choose not to prepay the Import Costs:</strong>You bear the responsibility of paying all actual Import Costs. If a party other than you pays some or all the actual Import Costs on your behalf in order to effect clearance, you will reimburse, upon request, that entity in full for the actual Import Costs. Your failure to pay Import Costs in a timely manner may cause delivery delays and may also put you at liability for tariffs and additional fees</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="blockQuote">You should contact the applicable customs office for details on what Import Costs, requirements, and procedures may be applicable to your purchase. </div>


<h2 class="blockQuote">Section 9: Additional Terms</h2>
<div class="blockQuote">Your use of the products and services we offer may be subject to the additional terms of our Suppliers which will be presented to you at the time of your purchase or which may be delivered to you with your product or service. Prior to completing your purchase, carefully read any additional terms and conditions that are presented to you. Do not complete the sale if you do not agree to those terms. Where additional terms are delivered with your product or service, you must review them immediately. If you do not agree to those terms, you must not use the product or service and contact customer service to begin a return.</div>
<div class="blockQuote">Where the product or service we offer for sale is software, we are offering you a license to use the software. Except where permitted by law or by the license terms presented, the software may not be copied, adapted, translated, made available, distributed, varied, modified, disassembled, decompiled, reverse engineered, or combined with any other software.</div>
<div class="blockQuote">With respect to your purchase of a right to use a service, such as with a warranty, software-as-a-service, or a digital admission for an offering operated and offered by our Supplier or a third party, we are selling you an intangible right to access, use, or participate in that third-party service for a specified period of time.  We are not the operator of service and make no representations or guarantees as to the availability of that service. </div>


<h2 class="blockQuote">Section 10: Shipping and Delivery</h2>
<div class="blockQuote">If we accept your offer, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to ship and deliver physical products to the destination you specified in the ordering process and indicated on the order acknowledgment we send you. You must check the delivery address you provided during the ordering process (“Delivery Address”). If there are any errors or omissions, you must contact us to correct the Delivery Address as soon as possible. We cannot change the shipping address after your order has been processed and fulfilled. We reserve the right to cancel your order and/or charge you for any extra costs that arise as a result of any change in the delivery address on your part. </div>
<div class="blockQuote">Any delivery time frames we provide during the checkout process are estimates only and are not guaranteed.  </div>
<div class="blockQuote">Where we deliver product in installments, each installment constitutes a separate contract. Any defect in one or more installment does not entitle you to repudiate the contract as a whole or cancel any subsequent installment.</div>


<h2 class="blockQuote">Section 11: Returns and Refunds</h2>
<div class="blockQuote">Please refer to the return policy presented on the Site for any return policy that applies to your purchase.  Any right of return applicable to your purchase of software does not apply in the event you open the software shrink-wrap, break the license seal, and/or use the software. In the absence of a Supplier return policy, Digital River offers a standard 30-day return policy for eligible products</div>
<div class="blockQuote">For shoppers outside of the United States, special terms may apply to your right to return and refund. Please see the <a href="#local_international_terms">Local International Terms</a> section below. </div>
<div class="blockQuote">If you have questions about your order, please contact us at <a href="mailto:onlinestore.en.cs@digitalriver.com">onlinestore.en.cs@digitalriver.com</a> and we will direct your inquiry to the appropriate customer service team for your order.</div>


<h2 class="blockQuote">Section 12: Title and Risk of Loss</h2>
<div class="blockQuote">Provided your designated payment method has been honored, (1) title to physical products transfers to you when we deliver the physical products to the Delivery Address; (2) title of digital products and services transfers when we make the product available for download. </div>
<div class="blockQuote">Risk of loss (1) for physical products transfers to you when we deliver the physical goods to the delivery address; and (2) for digital products and services when we make the product available for download. If no signature is required for the delivery of physical goods, you accept all risk of loss for theft or loss when we deliver the product to the delivery address. </div>
<div class="blockQuote">If you refuse delivery when our designated carrier attempts to make delivery of any physical products, you assume any risk of loss or damage to the products when the carrier attempts delivery. In that event, (1) you are still liable for the full payment for the products that the carrier attempted to deliver; (2) you are liable for any additional costs attributable to your failure to take delivery, including storage costs; and (3) after 30 days, we shall be entitled to dispose of the products in a manner we deem appropriate and may set off any proceeds of a sale against any sums you owe us.</div>


<h2 class="blockQuote">Section 13: Warranty</h2>
<div class="blockQuote">Except where required by law, or otherwise provided by us in writing, we offer no warranty on the products and services we sell. We make no statements as to the quality, fitness for a specific purpose, performance, correspondence with description, software installation, configuration, or error or defect correction. You will receive the benefit of any warranty offered by the manufacturer, licensor, or supplier of the product or services in connection with the sale. For details of any warranty applicable to your purchase, refer to the relevant documentation supplied with the product or on the Site where you purchased your product or service. This documentation may also contain the procedures applicable to the repair or replacement of defective products.</div>

<h2 class="blockQuote">Section 16: Dispute Resolution</h2>
<div class="blockQuote">We hope that you are completely satisfied with the purchase of your product or service. We will make every reasonable effort to resolve any disagreements that you have with us. However, if we are unable to resolve any dispute that arises in connection with your transaction, this Site, or these Terms to your satisfaction, this section governs the dispute resolution process.</div>
<div class="blockQuote">For shoppers outside of the United States, special terms may apply to your right to Dispute Resolution. Please see the <a href="#local_international_terms">Local International Terms</a> section below.</div>
<div class="blockQuote"><strong>Arbitration Provision</strong></div>
<div class="blockQuote">Any claim, dispute, or controversy you may have against us arising out of, relating to, or connected with this Site or your transaction shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by the AAA, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable) and as amended by these Terms (“Arbitration Rules and Procedures”). </div>
<div class="blockQuote">The AAA’s Rules, and a form for initiating arbitration proceedings, are available at the AAA’s website located at <a href="http://www.adr.org">http://www.adr.org</a>. </div>
<div class="blockQuote">This section applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law. The disputes governed by this Section include without limitation (1) claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us; (2) claims that arose out of your use of the Site; and (3) claims currently the subject of a purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class. </div>
<div class="blockQuote">However, the dispute resolution procedure specifically does not apply to (1) a claim relating to the enforcement or validity of your or our intellectual property rights; or (2) a claim relating to an allegation of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use.</div>
<div class="blockQuote">You agree that: (1) the arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, including principles of equity, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized by law; (2) the arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving us, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving both you and us to the extent required by applicable law; (3) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.</div>
<div class="blockQuote"><strong>You and we agree that (1) each of us can only bring claims against the other on an individual basis and there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis; (2) arbitration can decide only your and/or our individual claims, and the arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s); and (3) the arbitrator may not consolidate or join claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated and may not otherwise preside of any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding.</strong> If any section of this paragraph is determined to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither party shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.</div>
<div class="blockQuote">Except as specified in the paragraph immediately above, if any part of this Arbitration Provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures established by the AAA, then remaining provisions of the Arbitration Provision will not be affected and will be enforced to the fullest extent of the law.</div>
<div class="blockQuote"><strong>Governing Law and Venue</strong></div>
<div class="blockQuote">In the event that the above Arbitration Provision does not apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and us must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Hennepin County, Minnesota, and both you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Hennepin County, Minnesota for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes applying the law of the state of New York, United States of America.</div>


<h2 class="blockQuote">Section 17: Severability</h2>
<div class="blockQuote">If any provision (or part of a provision) of the Terms is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity of the remaining provisions will not be affected and will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law.</div>


<h2 class="blockQuote">Section 18: No Waiver</h2>
<div class="blockQuote">Any delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Term does not constitute a waiver on our part. A waiver of any breach or default in one instance does not constitute a waiver of any breach or default in a subsequent breach or default. No waiver by us will be effective unless it is in writing, signed by us. </div>
