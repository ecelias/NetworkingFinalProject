<p>
Some of the Personal Information listed above may be considered Sensitive Personal Information under relevant privacy laws. Depending on your state of residence, this may&nbsp;include social security number, driver’s license and other government identification card information, race, ethnicity, religion, precise geolocation data, and your American Honda account login credentials. Each type of Sensitive Personal Information may overlap with a category of Personal Information listed above. Additionally, some of the Personal Information listed above may be considered “personal information” as defined in Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e).</p>
<p>If you complete a credit application, upload documents required as part of a dealer transaction, or make a payment to a dealer through our Sites, we or our service provider(s) collect additional Personal Information and documents on behalf of the applicable dealer and its lending partners.

<p>To personalize your experience with our digital properties, we may ask for and retain records of your choices related to consent and content.</p>
<h4>Usage Data and Site Activity</h4>

If we can reasonably associate this data with you, directly or indirectly, we treat it as Personal Information under the categories of Identifiers or Internet or other electronic network information, as appropriate.

We refer to this type of data as “Anonymized Data” because it no longer qualifies as Personal Information. We may use and disclose Anonymized Data for any purpose without restriction, to the extent permitted by law. We will not knowingly attempt to reidentify Anonymized Data.</p>

<h3>IV. COOKIES, ONLINE TRACKING, AND TARGETED ADVERTISING</h3>
<h4>What are Cookies and Tracking Technologies?</h4>
<p>“Cookie(s)” is a blanket term used to describe several kinds of technology that are used on websites for a variety of purposes. In general, a cookie is a small piece of information that a website places on a user’s computer. We use first-party cookies to improve user experience on our Sites. When a user visits one of our Sites, it may ask their browser to store a cookie on their device to remember information about them such as identifying their computer and browser, language preference, or login information.&nbsp; We also use third-party cookies. These are from a different website domain and they support our advertising and marketing efforts. <strong></strong></p>
<p>We may also use “tracking pixels” and “clear gifs” to track user activity. Tracking pixels are pieces of executable code embedded in a web page that track usage activity including which pages users view, when users view them, and how long users view them. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers embedded in web pages and email messages that track whether a user views a particular web page or email message. We or third parties may associate user activity information with additional information about a user’s session or other Personal Information about the user, if available.</p>
<p>Cookies may make your browsing experience better. However, you may prefer to disable cookies on our Sites and on others. Details follow in this section about cookies and how you can manage them.</p>
<h4>Site Performance and Analytics</h4>
<p>We and third parties use cookies and other tracking technologies to enhance your user experience and analyze performance and traffic on our Sites. The information collected might relate to you, your preferences, or your device, and is used to provide expected web functionality and to deliver a more personalized web experience. Cookies help us understand the way consumers use our Sites and to measure the performance of the Sites and their features. </p>
<p>These cookies are unique to your device or your browser. Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire. Many browsers default to accepting cookies. You may be able to change this setting in your browser and you can also clear the cookies. If you do so, you may lose functionality on our Sites. Check your browser’s help function to learn more about your cookie setting options. </p>
<h4>Targeted Advertising</h4>
<p>We may work with third-party advertisers, search providers, and ad networks (“Advertisers”) to learn more about you and show you targeted ads or other content that we or they believe would be relevant to you. Advertisers may collect and use information about your use of the Sites or Services as well as other websites and services through cookies and other online tracking technologies. We and/or Advertisers may also append other data to the data collected by Advertisers to create an interest profile of individual users. Our Privacy Notice does not govern how an Advertiser may use your information after they collect it from you. Advertisements may be shown via the Sites or on third-party websites.</p>
<h4>Advertising and Analytics</h4>
<p>If you arrive at our Sites via an advertisement (e.g., banner ad), we&nbsp;and/or Advertisers may collect information regarding the advertisement with which you interacted and your actions related to it (e.g., item clicked, date, and time). </p>
<h4>Social Media Features</h4>
<p>The Sites may include social media features, such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Snapchat, Twitter, and YouTube widgets. The third parties that provide these features may collect information about your device (such as IP address) and the pages you visit on our Sites as well as other Personal Information. A cookie may be set to ensure that a feature properly functions. Your interactions with the social media features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them and you should review the relevant privacy policies before interacting with the social media features.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Referring Websites</h4>
<p>You should review the privacy policy of any website from which you reached the Sites to determine what information was collected by that website and for what purpose(s) you agreed that website could use that information. We may retain information about you provided to us by other websites and will only use it in accordance with this Privacy Notice.</p>

<em></em>
<h4>Third-Party Sharing and Selling</h4>
<p>Although we do not directly monetize your Personal Information, we may disclose it or allow third parties to collect it in limited situations that may qualify as a sale under certain privacy laws.

The summary chart included below includes more details on disclosures and/or third-party collections within the past 12 months that may qualify as a sale or sharing for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes.</p>
<h4>Partnerships and Co-Branded Websites </h4>
<p>We sometimes partner with companies whose products or offerings may be of interest to you. We strive to be transparent by co-branding jointly operated Sites and clearly posting a message if you leave our Sites and navigate to another. When you visit or use a website that is co-branded or that is a part of a joint promotion involving American Honda and one or more third parties (each a “Co-Branded Party”), you provide your Personal Information to each Co-Branded Party subject to their own privacy policies. We do not control Co-Branded Parties’ use or treatment of information you provide to them, and you should consult each of their privacy policies or any separate Co-Branded Privacy Notice posted on or linked from the Co-Branded sites to determine your rights with respect to their use and treatment of your information.

<h3>VIII.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;STATE SPECIFIC RIGHTS</h3>
<p> If you are a resident of a state that affords you consumer rights governing data usage, you may have additional rights to access and control your Personal Information that we process on our own behalf. Exemptions may apply.</p>
<h4>Right to Opt-Out from the Sale or Sharing of Personal Information (Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information Request) </h4>
<p>
You have the right to direct us not to sell or share (for targeted advertising purposes) your Personal Information to third parties. We will process requests within 15 business days, subject to any applicable exceptions and extensions permitted by law. </p>
<p>
Certain Sites also recognize and process<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/" target="_blank"> Global Privacy Control</a> (GPC) signals. When these Sites receive a GPC signal, we treat it as a request to opt-out of the sale or sharing of that user's Personal Information collected while the signal is present. To opt-out of offline sales and sharing scenarios, please use one of the methods described below.</p>
<h4>Right to Know (Personal Information Disclosure Request)</h4>
<p>You have the right to request twice in a 12-month period that we provide you (i) the categories or specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you; (ii) the categories of sources from which we collected your Personal Information; (iii) the business or commercial purposes for which we collected, sold, or shared your Personal Information; (iv) the categories of Personal Information we disclosed to Service Providers or third parties for a business purpose and the categories of Service Providers and third parties to whom we disclosed it; and (v) the categories of third parties to whom we sold/shared your Personal Information and the categories of Personal Information sold/shared to each category of third party. We cannot provide access to specific pieces of Personal Information if the Personal Information is sensitive or creates a high risk of potential harm from disclosure to an unauthorized person. To protect your Personal Information, we will take steps to validate your identity before any information is disclosed which may require you to provide additional information or documents. We will process verified requests within 45 days, subject to any applicable exceptions and extensions permitted by law. <strong></strong></p>
<h4>Right to Deletion (Delete My Personal Information Request)</h4>
<p>You have the right to request that we delete Personal Information we collected about you. Please understand that we are not required to honor a deletion request if a legal exemption applies such as if we need the information to complete a requested or reasonably anticipated transaction, prevent security incidents or fraud, enable internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations, or comply with legal obligations. To protect your Personal Information, we will take steps to validate your identity before your request is processed which may require you to provide additional information or documents. We will process verified requests within 45 days, subject to any applicable exceptions and extensions permitted by law. </p>
<h4>Limit Use of Sensitive Personal Information</h4>
<p>Certain states allow you to request that we limit the use of your Sensitive Personal Information to only exempt purposes such as to provide the goods and services you requested, prevent fraud, or verify or maintain the quality or safety of goods or services we provide. Other states may require us to obtain your consent to process Sensitive Personal Information. The definitions of Sensitive Personal Information vary by state. </p>
<p>We will process requests to limit use of Sensitive Personal Information within 15 business days, subject to any extensions permitted by law. </p>
<p>If you reside in a state that requires consent to process Sensitive Personal Information, we treat your request to limit as a revocation of consent to process such information. Requests to limit and revocations of consent are subject to exceptions permitted by applicable laws. </p>
<h4>Right to Opt-Out of Automated Decision-making and Profiling</h4>
<p>You have the right to direct us not process your data for automated decision making and profiling that produce legal or other similarly significant effects. Although we do not currently conduct such profiling, you may opt-out now to prevent future practices, if any, that qualify. Where permitted by applicable law,&nbsp;we may take steps to validate your identity before your request is processed which may require you to provide additional information or documents. We will process verified requests within 15 business days, such to any applicable exceptions and extensions permitted by law.</p>
<h4>Right to Correct</h4>
<p>If you believe that your information is inaccurate, you may submit a Correct My Data Request. When you make your request, please be sure to provide us the specific information that you believe is inaccurate and the correct information. You should also provide us with any documentation you believe supports your proposed correction, and we will take that documentation into consideration. We will only correct the information if we determine, based on the totality of the circumstances, that your correction is more likely than not accurate. We may also choose to delete the allegedly inaccurate information instead of correcting it. We will process verified requests within 45 days, subject to any applicable exceptions and extensions permitted by law. </p>
<h4>Right to Appeal</h4>
<p>If we deny a previous privacy rights request in full or in part, you have the right to appeal that decision. If we deny your appeal, you may also contact your state Attorney General to lodge a complaint and we may provide you with an online mechanism to do so when we communicate our denial to you. We will process verified requests within 45 days, subject to any applicable exceptions and extensions permitted by law. <strong><br>
