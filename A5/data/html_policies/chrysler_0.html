Effective Date: July 1, 2024 </p> </div>
<div class="content_7 content">
<p>FCA US LLC (“<b>FCA US</b>,” “<b>we</b>” or “<b>us</b>”)<b> </b>is committed to privacy and transparency in our information practices. This FCA US Privacy Policy (our “<b>Privacy Policy</b>”) describes how we collect, use, disclose, share, and otherwise process the personal information described in this Privacy Policy, as well as the rights and choices individuals have regarding their personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a California resident, please review our <a href="#par-14" rel="par-14">California Privacy Supplement</a> for additional information about our privacy practices and your California privacy rights, including your right to opt out of sales and sharing of personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“<b>CCPA</b>”).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Your access to and use of our Services (as defined below) is subject to our applicable terms and agreements, including the <a href="https://www.chrysler.com/crossbrand_us/terms-of-use">FCA Website Terms of Use</a>, and, as applicable, our App End User License Agreement, the <a href="https://connect.jeep.com/us/en/terms-and-conditions/latest">FCA Connected Service Terms of Service</a>, and the <a href="https://www.driveuconnect.com/sirius-xm-guardian/terms.html">SiriusXM Guardian Terms of Services</a> (collectively, the “<b>Terms</b>”). These Terms are incorporated by reference into this Privacy Policy, including their applicable limitations on liability and the resolution of disputes.</p>
<br> <h2 id="par-1">1. SCOPE</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information related to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Our websites (each a “<b>Website</b>”), mobile applications (each an “<b>App</b>”), and online services that link to or display this Privacy Policy, and our “<b>Connected Services</b>” (as defined and further described in our <a href="https://www.driveuconnect.com/connectedservices/privacy.html">Connected Services Privacy Notice</a>), as well as the services that FCA makes available to through each of these (collectively, the “<b>Services</b>”).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Current and former FCA vehicle owners and Connected Services users.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Shoppers and prospective purchasers of FCA vehicles, products, and services and other individuals who receive our marketing and promotional communications.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Participants in contests, promotions, surveys, and other events that we conduct or sponsor.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Individuals that otherwise contact us or interact with us related to our vehicles, the Services, or our business operations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is intended to describe our overall privacy practices with regard to the personal information subject to this Policy. Our actual collection, use, disclosure, and processing of personal information about individuals will vary depending upon the circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Additional Privacy Notices and Terms.</h3>
<p>We may also provide additional privacy notices (“additional notice”) for specific products, programs, events, promotions, services, features, incentives, or other offers that we provide or make available.
