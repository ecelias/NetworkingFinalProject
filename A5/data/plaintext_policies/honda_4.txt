Welcome to our Privacy Center
At Honda, The Power of Dreams drives us to create intelligent products that enhance mobility and increase the joy in people's daily lives.
We strive to earn the trust and support of the many diverse communities we are honored to serve. As an owner of our products or as a consumer interested in our brands, we want you to feel secure and valued in all your interactions with our company. Honda's excellence in product engineering is matched by excellence in the customer experience, which is sometimes enabled by the responsible use of certain customer data.
We want our communication and features to meet your high expectations and enhance your enjoyment of our products and services. One of the ways we do that is to collect and use certain Personal Information to help deliver personalized experiences when you interact with us across our family of brands.
We recognize the importance of protecting the confidentiality and security of your Personal Information. Accordingly, we employ governance and safeguards to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure, and use.
The types of Personal Information we collect vary based on how you use our Sites (like websites and mobile applications) and Services (directly or indirectly, through any other means, including offline activities) and your relationship with us. Our products and the way they operate are complex. To serve you better, we may provide certain Personal Information to service providers, Honda and Acura dealerships, Honda affiliates (including American Honda Finance Corporation), and other companies that provide or enhance services to us or to you on our behalf. These services help provide useful and enjoyable experiences such as seamless integration of our digital properties and in-vehicle features that use geolocation. Although we do not directly monetize your Personal Information, we may disclose it or allow third parties to collect it in limited situations that may qualify as a sale under certain privacy laws. 
We want our disclosures to you to be transparent and easy to find. You can click our Privacy Notice and Vehicle Data Privacy Notice to read more about the ways we collect, use, and disclose your Personal Information, how you can exercise any rights you might have with respect to this information, and how to reach us with any questions. Thank you for taking time to learn about our privacy practices.
