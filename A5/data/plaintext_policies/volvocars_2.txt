How long we keep your data
Please refer to each cookie description for their specific retention periods. 
For your information, we use two different types of cookies: session cookies that are temporary and expire once you close your browser or when your session ends, and persistent cookies that remain on your hard drive until you or your browser erase them, depending on the cookie's expiration date.
For analytics purposes the data that is not aggregated or anonymised right away will be processed for not more than 2 years.
Furthermore, in certain instances local storage is used. Since the data placed there does not expire and will be available any time you open our website, the only way to clear local storage is for you to clear the browser storage manually (also known as clearing caches).
Who we share your personal data with
Your personal data will be disclosed to and processed by our affiliates and business partners for the above purposes and as described in the cookies' description. We also share your personal data with processors, especially IT service providers, which are limited by contract in their ability to use your personal data for any purpose other than to provide services for us in compliance with each data processing agreement in place. Your personal data may be transferred to a country outside the European Economic Area. If so, such transfer will be based on the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission. The general text of the standard contractual clauses used can be found in various languages on the homepage of the EU Commission.
