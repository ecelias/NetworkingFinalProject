Such measures may also be implemented for compliance purposes or to avoid sharing your personal information with any untrusted third parties.

A second incident will lead to the suspension of any further calls from the user in question for a period of 4 months. During this period, the user will still be able to contact our customer services by other communication channels (e.g., regular mail or email) so we can attend their queries and preserve their rights at any given time.

FOR HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Our general approach is to retain your personal information only for as long as it is needed.
When you have a Bottega Veneta profile, a temporary record or subscribe to our newsletters, we generally retain your personal information for 5 years from the last interaction you initiated with us.
When you interact with our customer services, we generally retain the recordings of the calls for 40 days (unless a longer retention period is permitted by law), and the other personal information you have shared with us (including personal information shared by mail, chat or text message or when our interaction is transcribed) for 5 years from the last interaction you initiated with us.
We may retain personal information for a shorter or longer time, for instance, where we are obliged to do so in accordance with relevant legal, tax and accounting requirements.
Read more Read more
Last interaction shall be defined as the last contact you initiated which is traceable by our systems or by a sales associate. Last contact could be the last time a call, sales email, or meeting was proposed to you and to which you responded favorably. For instance, clicking on a link included in an email (except for a link to unsubscribe from receiving marketing content), having a chat on our website or attending an appointment in one of our stores are considered a last contact. Conversely, opening an email or visiting our website without logging in would not qualify as last contact.
Before deleting your personal information from your Bottega Veneta or temporary record, we will contact you to inform you of such deletion and you may ask us to keep your personal information. By not answering you agree to the deletion of any personal information that we are not legally obliged to keep for longer in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements.
We will delete or destroy your personal information without delay once it is no longer necessary (e.g., if the purposes of collection/use of the personal information have been accomplished, if the statutory retention period expires) in a way that prevents such personal information from being restored or recovered. If printed on paper, the personal information will be destroyed by shredding, incinerating, or some other similar method and, if saved in electronic form, the personal information will be destroyed by technical methods which ensure that the personal information cannot be restored or recovered thereafter.
In specific circumstances we may also retain your personal information for longer according to the applicable statute of limitations so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges.
It is also possible that certain information which we consider to be important for Bottega Veneta history or patrimony may be retained by us for longer periods exclusively for archival purposes, for historical purposes or for statistical purposes. This may be the case when some of our notable customers have benefited from our services or bought our products.

HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We, Bottega Veneta , are strongly committed to keeping your personal information safe.
To do so, we design our services with your safety in mind. Within our group, we have dedicated teams managing and ensuring the security and privacy of your personal information. We have adopted specific technical and organisational security measures, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, to protect personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access.
For example, whenever personal information is passed between your device and our servers, we ensure that it is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") and other security methods. We implement Hyper Text Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer ("HTTPS") in order to protect your connection to our website. All your personal information is stored on secured servers.
We have also established a specialised personal information security management system. For example, we strictly control the scope of authorisation of our employees who have access to the personal information that we collect and process. We thus disclose or provide access to your personal information only on a strict need to know basis to our employees or to the third parties listed in the section With whom do we share your personal information?, and only through secured systems. We regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against any unauthorised access and use.
We conduct security and privacy protection training courses and tests on a regular basis to enhance our employees' awareness of the importance of protecting personal information. We take commercially reasonable steps to make sure that our business partners and third-party service providers are able to protect your personal information. Our employees and those of our business partners and third-party service providers who have access to your personal information are subject to enforceable contractual obligations of confidentiality and specific contractual privacy provisions.
In the event of a security incident resulting in any breach of personal information, as qualified by law, we have an emergency response plan in place to prevent the expansion of such security incidents. In addition, we will report such personal information breach to the relevant supervisory authority as required by applicable law, and inform you via an appropriate channel as and where required by applicable law.
Please also note that in order to keep your personal information secure, we may from time to time, have to reset your password.
However, you should be aware that no service can be completely secure, and you play a key role in keeping your personal information safe. For the best possible protection of your personal information outside the limits of our control, your devices should be protected (e.g. by updated antivirus software) and your internet service providers should take appropriate measures for the security of personal information transmission over the network (e.g. with firewalls and anti-spam filtering). You accept the inherent security implications of interacting over the Internet and will not hold us or our partners responsible for any security incident or breach of personal information unless it is due to our negligence.
If you have any concerns that your personal information has been put at risk, for example if someone could have found out your password, please contact us as soon as possible.

For sake of clarity, please note that such partners also carry out processing activities in parallel for their own purposes, acting then as data controllers (see Approved partners acting also on their own account below). In this respect, our privacy policy does not extend to the processing activities carried out by these partners where the latter are acting on their own account, as data controller for the performance of their services. 
This can be the case when payment services provider carries out fraud detection processes. These other companies have their own privacy policies in place, so remember that the way they use any personal information you give them will be subject to their rules and not ours.

Once you have requested us to create your Bottega Veneta profile, via Bottega Veneta websites or any other means, including our customer service, your personal information will be linked to this profile, where we will keep all the information we have on you. This could include personal information we obtain directly from you as well as from other sources in accordance with applicable legislation. This could also include information about the purchases made when checking out as a guest or when checking out using a profile. The information in your Bottega Veneta profile is crucial to provide you with the Bottega Veneta personalized and tailored experience, and in some cases is necessary in order to access to some specific services or to purchase from our website, and thus it needs to be kept up to date for the best experience.
Read more Read more
Once you have asked us to create your Bottega Veneta profile, we will supplement it with personal information such as your purchases, preferences and contact details. In this context, please be aware that we use personal identification information, such as your email address or phone number, to link an interaction or a purchase with your Bottega Veneta profile. This also applies when checking-out as a guest on our website when making a purchase, as mentioned above, or in case you bind your social media open ID account with your Bottega Veneta profile (by using dedicated QR Codes for example). In addition, we may use your date of birth to determine that you are old enough to use our services.
In order to keep your personal information accurate, we will take every reasonable step to ensure that personal information we hold is properly updated. Subject to your applicable privacy legislation you may have the right to have your information rectified at any time, and in event please let us know if any of your information needs updating or correcting, and we will make our best efforts to detect and correct inaccurate personal information (data cleansing) and delete any duplicated dataset. This may require us to correct typographical errors or inconsistent personal information.

Your use of our websites may be recorded or monitored using "session replay" which allows us to see how you interact with our website, including your mouse movements, key strokes, or other interactions. This allows us to provide better customer service to you and to improve the quality of our products and services. 
In addition, the monitoring of our interaction (including, with prior notice to you, via voice or video recording, such as real time listening or analysis, or listening in real time,) enables us to improve the quality and safety of our services and to provide you with tailored answers. 
All our customers are important to us. However, some of our customers and potential customers benefit from a more personalized experience due to the important relationship they keep with Bottega Veneta. Our teams may need to collect and gather information on such customers or potential customers in order to identify personalities who correspond to the image and values of Bottega Veneta to offer them unique support. This may be the case when you participate in one of our selective projects or when our Sales Associates offers you to participate in events or contacts you for certain special occasions (for your birthdays or for a particular event of your life).
To enable you to receive relevant information and tailored marketing content.

Such communication can be global or local, and may include updates about our products and services, notifications, invitations to events, offers, surveys, etc.]
Our communications will be customised and specifically designed to be of interest to you, and will be updated with any new personal information linked to your Bottega Veneta profile. We will thus use your personal information to send you tailored communications or other customised advertisements or marketing campaigns. This use of your data includes some profiling activity.

With this information, we may create groups of similar customers (called "persona") to whom we can decide to offer personalised content and experiences both in inbound or outbound interactions. In this context, we may make inferences about you, as derived from your personal information (profiling). For example, if you always purchase our products from the same store (specific location or online), we may consider this store as your preferred one. This will allow us to customise your experience with Bottega Veneta based on your interests and shopping habits (i.e. tailored communication). In order to provide you with such customised and personalised experience, in our stores or online, you may be required to log in or identify yourself. 
To enrich your personal information, we may use cookies or other online advertising technologies. Via such technologies, we will collect personal information related to your activities on social media and your browsing activity across different websites and devices (for example: to know if you have visited our website after opening a newsletter you have received). Certain technologies may rely on services provided by other companies acting on their own account (such as social media WeChat, WhatsApp, Baidu, Kakao Talk, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or other online platforms). These companies have their own privacy and cookies policies and the way they use the personal information you share with them will be subject to their rules and not ours. 
To enrich your personal information, we can match it with personal information held by others (for example, by sharing and matching your information with information held by trusted partners, or by binding your social media open ID account with your Bottega Veneta profile (by using the dedicated QR Codes for example). This process will only be conducted by using customers' unique identifiers and reidentification protocols in order to protect the confidentiality of your personal information.
Personal information linked to your Bottega Veneta profile (your identification personal information such as your e-mail address, phone number, social network id, etc.) will enable us to reach you on third-party platforms or to create " lookalike campaigns", allowing us to find new people who are likely to be interested in our products because they may be similar to you. We may conduct such campaigns through our website, social media or other communication means such as search engine. When this kind of campaigns are conducted, before it is shared, your personal information is hashed and turned into short fingerprints that cannot be reversed.
Using cookies or other online advertising technologies may also enable us to show you online advertisements that are "contextual" (meaning they are shown according to the webpage you are browsing), or "behavioural" or "interest based" (where advertisements are shown to you based on your interests which we have inferred from your information including demographic, geographic and interest-based data). We may use such advertisements to display products or services that are most relevant to you.
If you no longer want to see customised online advertisements, you may request us to delete your Bottega Veneta profile or modify your cookie preferences, see "cookies or other online advertising technologies". In addition, some third-party sites allow you to stop seeing advertisements from specific advertisers, so you may also set your preferences on those websites.

Non-marketing communications may be sent upon your request, and may be important for your safety and the security of your personal information.
You may still receive such communications even when you opt-out from certain marketing communications. The information communicated may be necessary for the correct performance of our contract with you or be mandatory to comply with some of our legal obligations.

To manage our social networks
Bottega Veneta manages "Fan" pages available on several social networks. We may need to process the information made available by the different platforms or when you interact with our pages and publications.
Read more Read more
When, as a user, you decide to interact with our social media pages (e.g. when you follow one of our pages, when you click "Like" on Facebook or "Follow" on Instagram or add a reaction to a post, when you "share" or add a "comment", etc.), we have access to public information in your profile. Your information is used for the purpose of interacting with you through the social network in question or to establish analyzes or statistics on the use of our pages or on the performance of our communications. Our services may remove your comments if they do not comply with our policies on the use of social networks (e.g. if your comments are insulting, illegal or malicious). 
When you visit our "Fan" page, when you do not have an account or are not logged in to the relevant social network, we do not collect any personal information about you, except for the aggregated data provided to us by each social network.
To conduct our business securely and protect our activities and personnel.
To deliver our products and services safely to you, perform our contract properly or comply with some of our legal obligations, we will implement fraud prevention and detection measures. Such measures will allow us to adequately perform our contract with you and protect our legitimate interests in defending ourselves against fraud. We may notably implement measures to ensure that you are complying with our terms and conditions for sales, available on this website, offers and programs, and to prevent and detect non-compliance or fraud by you. This may include reviewing and assessing your dealings with us, your eligibility to participate in certain sales, offers and programs, your compliance with the terms and conditions of such sales, offers and programs, and undertaking enforcement action and disciplinary action where such non-compliance or fraud is suspected or identified.
Read more Read more
We may use administrative and technical measures to protect, our website, our systems, our networks, transactions occurring on our website or in our stores, and any other necessary means to protect the personal information we may access or store. For this purpose, we may also be required to verify your identity or to take note of any suspicious or actual non-compliance with our terms and conditions or fraud we incurred with respect to your dealings with us. Such measures may also be implemented for compliance purposes or to avoid sharing your personal information with any untrusted third parties. For example, when you purchase a product, your personal information will be associated with a unique code placed into and printed on such product so that by reading the unique code we can recognize the order as yours, to enable us to assess your compliance with our terms and conditions or to detect fraud by you, and to take enforcement and disciplinary action against you in the event of suspected or identified non-compliance or fraud by you.
In addition, we may implement certain measures to protect and defend our rights and property, our employees and our business partners in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and international conventions. For example, we can monitor our inbound and outbound interaction with our customer service (including via voice or video recording or listening in real time, with prior notice to you); also, mindful of the health of our employees, and for this sole purpose, we implement an anti-malicious calls procedure so that any occurrence of inappropriate behaviors such as harassment, insults or direct threats from users will be reported to our dedicated team. This will generate a warning to the concerned user and they will be recorded on our provisional list. The initial warning will set out the consequences of a second incident occurring. A second incident will lead to the suspension of any further calls from the user in question for a period of 4 months. During this period, the user will still be able to contact our customer services by other communication channels (e.g., regular mail or email) so we can attend their queries and preserve their rights at any given time.
To assess and better understand our business.
To manage our activities, perform our obligations under our contract with you and comply with our legal obligations, we may need to access and use some of your personal information for finance, management or legal purposes, or business-related analytics & market research activities.

In certain limited circumstances, such activity may be based on our legitimate interest when related to business analytics & market research activities

We may also conduct various business-related analytics & market research activities, which may require us to access or otherwise use some of your personal information, or to send you surveys or customer satisfaction questions in order to gather new or additional information. This notably enables us to analyse and learn how our customers use and interact with us in order to improve products, services and our business in general. It is also important for us to conduct operations that allow us to analyze and measure the performance of our marketing or communications campaigns. This may be the case, for example, when you click on one of our ads on our business partners website or when you make a purchase after viewing one of their ads.

Such measures will allow us to adequately perform our contract with you and protect our legitimate interests in defending ourselves against fraud. We may notably implement measures to ensure that you are complying with our terms and conditions for sales, available in this website, offers and programs, and to prevent and detect non-compliance or fraud by you. This may include reviewing and assessing your dealings with us, your eligibility to participate in certain sales, offers and programs, your compliance with the terms and conditions of such sales, offers and programs, and undertaking enforcement action and disciplinary action where such non-compliance or fraud is suspected or identified.

We may use administrative and technical measures to protect, our website, our systems, our networks, transactions occurring on our website or in our stores, and any other necessary means to protect the personal information we may access or store. For this purpose, we may also be required to verify your identity or to take note of any suspicious or actual non-compliance with our terms and conditions or fraud we incurred with respect to your dealings with us. Such measures may also be implemented for compliance purposes or to avoid sharing your personal information with any untrusted third parties. For example, when you purchase a product, your personal information will be associated with a unique code placed into and printed on such product so that by reading the unique code we can recognize the order as yours, to enable us to assess your compliance with our terms and conditions or to detect fraud by you, and to take enforcement and disciplinary action against you in the event of suspected or identified non-compliance or fraud by you.

For example, we can monitor our inbound and outbound interaction with our customer service (including via voice or video recording or listening in real time, with prior notice to you); also, mindful of the health of our employees, and for this sole purpose, we implement an anti-malicious calls procedure so that any occurrence of inappropriate behaviors such as harassment, insults or direct threats from users will be reported to our dedicated team. This will generate a warning to the concerned user and they will be recorded on our provisional list. The initial warning will set out the consequences of a second incident occurring. A second incident will lead to the suspension of any further calls from the user in question for a period of 4 months. During this period, the user will still be able to contact our customer services by other communication channels (e.g., regular mail or email) so we can attend their queries and preserve their rights at any given time.
