At our discretion, we reserve the right to decline your offer and cancel your order. Any system generated order confirmation we send when you complete your order is an acknowledgement of your offer only and is not an acceptance of your offer, which is subject to correction before shipment of your physical products or delivery of your services. Upon successful verification of your order and payment information, Digital River will buy the merchandise you ordered from our Supplier for the purpose of reselling it to you.
By placing an order, you are consenting to our use of electronic communications related to your transaction and the electronic delivery of notices, policies, and records of the transaction.

We make every attempt to ensure that the products and services offered for sale on the Site are described and represented as accurately and as completely as possible. However, mistakes may occur and if there are errors, we reserve the right to correct and revise. 
Prices are subject to change. The prices payable are those prices in effect at the time of our acceptance of your offer and are in the currency presented on the Site. Unless otherwise indicated on the Site, prices for products and services do not include VAT, other taxes, delivery, export, or other charges. 
Section 6: Payment Terms
You agree to pay for the product through the payment methods offered on this Site. Those payment methods may be subject to their own terms and conditions.

Section 8: Customs and Import Costs
Your purchase of a physical product may be subject to customs tariffs, duties, fees, taxes, and other charges that may be payable in the destination country ("Import Costs").

You agree that you, as the receiving party in the product's destination country, are responsible for getting the products or services into the country you intend to use it, properly declaring the merchandise to the appropriate customs authorities, paying applicable Import Costs, and satisfying any additional import-related requirements.
When completing a sale, you may be given an option to prepay the Import Costs. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to estimate these Import Costs. However, because we do not control them, we cannot predict with 100% accuracy what the final Import Costs will be. You agree that the actual import costs may vary from our estimate. 
If you choose to prepay the Import Costs: Where the final Import Costs are greater than our estimate, we will not ask you to pay additional money, and where the final Import Costs are less than our estimate, we will not refund the difference.
If you choose not to prepay the Import Costs:You bear the responsibility of paying all actual Import Costs. If a party other than you pays some or all the actual Import Costs on your behalf in order to effect clearance, you will reimburse, upon request, that entity in full for the actual Import Costs. Your failure to pay Import Costs in a timely manner may cause delivery delays and may also put you at liability for tariffs and additional fees
You should contact the applicable customs office for details on what Import Costs, requirements, and procedures may be applicable to your purchase. 
Section 9: Additional Terms
Your use of the products and services we offer may be subject to the additional terms of our Suppliers which will be presented to you at the time of your purchase or which may be delivered to you with your product or service.

Except where permitted by law or by the license terms presented, the software may not be copied, adapted, translated, made available, distributed, varied, modified, disassembled, decompiled, reverse engineered, or combined with any other software.
With respect to your purchase of a right to use a service, such as with a warranty, software-as-a-service, or a digital admission for an offering operated and offered by our Supplier or a third party, we are selling you an intangible right to access, use, or participate in that third-party service for a specified period of time. We are not the operator of service and make no representations or guarantees as to the availability of that service.

If no signature is required for the delivery of physical goods, you accept all risk of loss for theft or loss when we deliver the product to the delivery address. 
If you refuse delivery when our designated carrier attempts to make delivery of any physical products, you assume any risk of loss or damage to the products when the carrier attempts delivery. In that event, you are still liable for the full payment for the products that the carrier attempted to deliver; you are liable for any additional costs attributable to your failure to take delivery, including storage costs; and after 30 days, we shall be entitled to dispose of the products in a manner we deem appropriate and may set off any proceeds of a sale against any sums you owe us.

Digital River's total aggregate liability arising out of or related to the purchase and sale of a product or services is limited to the amount you paid to Digital River for such product or service.
The above limitations of liability form the fundamental basis of the bargain between you and Digital River. The above cap on liability will not apply to liability for Digital River for death, personal injury, or property damage directly or proximately caused by the item you purchased from Digital River; or damages caused by Digital River's fraud, fraudulent misrepresentations, intentional misconduct, gross negligence, or any other matters for which liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

You agree to indemnify and hold Digital River, our parent, and each of our officers, employees, agents, partners, content providers, service providers, suppliers, and licensors (collectively "Released Parties") harmless from any and all claims, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising from your purchase of products and services made available through this Site; and your fraudulent or deceptive acts or omissions, or breach or violation of law, including infringement of any IP claim or breach of these Terms.
Section 16: Dispute Resolution
We hope that you are completely satisfied with the purchase of your product or service. We will make every reasonable effort to resolve any disagreements that you have with us. However, if we are unable to resolve any dispute that arises in connection with your transaction, this Site, or these Terms to your satisfaction, this section governs the dispute resolution process.
For shoppers outside of the United States, special terms may apply to your right to Dispute Resolution. Please see the Local International Terms section below.
Arbitration Provision
Any claim, dispute, or controversy you may have against us arising out of, relating to, or connected with this Site or your transaction shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by the AAA, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable) and as amended by these Terms ("Arbitration Rules and Procedures"). 
The AAA's Rules, and a form for initiating arbitration proceedings, are available at the AAA's website located at website_url_lnk 
This section applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law. The disputes governed by this Section include without limitation claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us; claims that arose out of your use of the Site; and claims currently the subject of a purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class. 
However, the dispute resolution procedure specifically does not apply to a claim relating to the enforcement or validity of your or our intellectual property rights; or a claim relating to an allegation of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use.
You agree that: the arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, including principles of equity, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized by law; the arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving us, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving both you and us to the extent required by applicable law; in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.
You and we agree that each of us can only bring claims against the other on an individual basis and there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis; arbitration can decide only your and our individual claims, and the arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party's individual claims; and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated and may not otherwise preside of any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. If any section of this paragraph is determined to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither party shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.
Except as specified in the paragraph immediately above, if any part of this Arbitration Provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures established by the AAA, then remaining provisions of the Arbitration Provision will not be affected and will be enforced to the fullest extent of the law.
Governing Law and Venue
In the event that the above Arbitration Provision does not apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and us must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Hennepin County, Minnesota, and both you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Hennepin County, Minnesota for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes applying the law of the state of New York, United States of America.
Section 17: Severability
If any provision (or part of a provision) of the Terms is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity of the remaining provisions will not be affected and will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law.
Section 18: No Waiver
Any delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Term does not constitute a waiver on our part. A waiver of any breach or default in one instance does not constitute a waiver of any breach or default in a subsequent breach or default. No waiver by us will be effective unless it is in writing, signed by us. 
Local International Terms
To our shoppers outside of the United States, the terms set forth below in this Local International Terms section are additional and supplemental to the Terms above. Where a provision within this section is inconsistent with the general terms outlined above, the terms specific to your jurisdiction will apply to your purchase
