Under applicable data protection law, your express consent is not always required for the use of cookies. In particular, ""technical cookies"", i.e., cookies used exclusively to transmit messages over an electronic communications network, or otherwise strictly necessary to provide a service explicitly requested by you, do not require your consent.

The standards we use to determine the retention periods include but are not limited to: the time required to retain personal data to fulfill business purposes, including providing products and services; maintaining corresponding transaction and business records; controlling and improving the performance and quality of the website; handling possible user queries or complaints and locating problems; whether the user agrees to a longer retention period; and whether the laws, contracts, and other equivalencies have special requirements for data retention.

Retention, California Residents
Best Buy has in place a records-retention schedule reflecting our intended retention periods for certain types of information. The following reflects the longest applicable intended retention period by personal-information category for information related to California consumers acquired on or after January 1, 2023. Once the intended retention period has passed, subject information is to be deleted or modified such that it is no longer personal information.
Personal Information Categories. Intended Retention Period 
Biometrics. Up to 10 years after last activity, subject to contractual obligations 
Commercial Information. 10 years after expiration of contractual obligations 
Education Information. 10 Years after termination of employment 
Geolocation Data. Up to 3 Years 
Identifiers. Up to 10 years after last activity, subject to contractual obligations 
Identifiers (Online). Up to 3 years 
Information Related to Characteristics Protected Under California or Federal Law. Up to 3 years 
Internet and Other Electronic Network Activity Information. Up to 3 years 
Other Financial, Medical and Health Information. Up to 10 years after last activity, subject to contractual obligations 
Professional or Employment Related Information. 10 Years after termination of employment 
Profile Inferences. Up to 3 years 
Sensory Information. Up to 40 days 
There are a number of reasons personal information may be retained longer than the intended retention period. For example, deletion or modification does not happen immediately after a retention period has passed and instead executes periodically, no less frequently than annually. Additionally, some information systems or information may be placed on legal holds due to potential litigation or regulatory review and information, therefore, is not deleted or modified.

You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your California Law rights. To exercise the California Law rights described above, please submit a consumer request to us by either Calling us at (800) 333-4KIA (4542)
To exercise your right to know, delete or correct your Personal Information as described above, we need to verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. These requests may be made only by you, your parent or guardian (if you are under 18 years of age), a person to whom you have given power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465, or an authorized agent that is registered with the California Secretary of State. If a parent or guardian is submitting a request on behalf of a minor, the parent or guardian must submit proof that they are the parent or guardian of the subject consumer, and must verify the consumer's identity. A downloadable Letter of Parent or Guardian form is available in the online request portal, and may be uploaded for submission once completed. If someone with power of attorney is making a request on behalf of a consumer, they must verify the individual consumer's identity and submit documentation establishing the power of attorney, such as by uploading it onto the online request portal. If an authorized agent is submitting a request on behalf of a consumer, they must verify the individual consumer's identity, provide written permission from the consumer to submit the request on the consumer's behalf, and submit documentation establishing registration with the Secretary of State. Such documentation may be uploaded onto the online request portal. If Kia cannot verify that the requestor is authorized by the consumer to act on such consumer's behalf, Kia is not obligated to provide information or respond to the request. If you have any questions about making a request on behalf of another consumer, please call us at 800-333-4KIA (4542).
Your verifiable consumer request to know/access, delete, or correct must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or that you are an authorized representative of such person. We will not respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. While we may ask for Personal Information to verify the requestor or consumer's identity when making a request, we will only use that Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. Additionally, you may only make a verifiable consumer request for access twice within a 12-month period. 
Notice of Financial Incentive
We may offer you various incentives, including special offers, discounts, rewards and coupons pursuant to certain rewards and loyalty programs (each, a ""Loyalty Program""), throughout the year for providing us with your Personal Information. Categories of Personal Information that may be collected pursuant to a Loyalty Program, include, but are not limited to: identifiers such as name, postal address, email address and telephone number; categories of Personal Information described in the California Customer Records statute; and commercial information.
We do not assign a monetary value to the data we collect, but based on a good-faith estimate, we believe the value received from your Personal Information is reasonably equal to the value of the benefit we offer you pursuant to a Loyalty Program. This estimate is not specific to any particular individual who participates in a Loyalty Program (a ""Member"") and may vary by Member. We have calculated such value by taking into consideration, without limitation, relevant factors related to the estimated value of such information to us, as set forth under California Law.
If eligible, you may opt in to a Loyalty Program by following the instructions set forth in a Loyalty Program's terms and conditions and, if applicable, by creating a member account on the Loyalty Program's website. Material terms of participating in a Loyalty Program, including all terms and conditions concerning the collection, use and retention of Members' Personal Information, the required arbitration of any disputes Members have, and the waiver of Members' ability to bring claims in class action format, are set forth in the applicable terms and conditions, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Service, and should be carefully reviewed prior to participation in a Loyalty Program.
You have the right to cancel your membership and participation in a Loyalty Program at any time. To opt out of a Loyalty Program, including the receipt of marketing emails provided pursuant to your status as a Member of a Loyalty Program, please call our Kia Customer Care Center at 1-800-333-4542. 
Response Timing and Format
With the exception of opt-out and limitation requests, which will be honored within fifteen business days of receipt, we will make our best effort to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. Within ten days of receiving the request, we will confirm receipt and provide information about our verification and processing of the request. Kia will maintain records of consumer requests made pursuant to the CCPA as well as our response to said requests for a period of at least twenty-four months.
If you have an account with us, we may require you to take delivery of our written response through that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response electronically, though you may alternatively choose to receive delivery by mail. The response will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. Requests for the specific pieces of information that we have collected about you will be sent in a portable, readily useable format that you may transmit to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. 
Your Rights Under ""Shine the Light""
In addition to your rights under California Law, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request information regarding our disclosure, if any, of their Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If this applies, you may obtain the categories of Personal Information disclosed and the names and addresses of all third parties that received Personal Information for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2024 will receive information about 2023 sharing activities). To make such a request, please provide sufficient information for us to determine if this applies to you, attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. You may make this request in writing to the Kia Customer Care Center: Box 52410, Irvine, CA 92619-2410.

https://www.honda.com,6,7,Yes,"VIII. STATE SPECIFIC RIGHTS
If you are a resident of a state that affords you consumer rights governing data usage, you may have additional rights to access and control your Personal Information that we process on our own behalf. Exemptions may apply.
Right to Opt-Out from the Sale or Sharing of Personal Information (Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information Request) 
You have the right to direct us not to sell or share (for targeted advertising purposes) your Personal Information to third parties. We will process requests within 15 business days, subject to any applicable exceptions and extensions permitted by law. 
Certain Sites also recognize and process Global Privacy Control signals. When these Sites receive a GPC signal, we treat it as a request to opt-out of the sale or sharing of that user's Personal Information collected while the signal is present. To opt-out of offline sales and sharing scenarios, please use one of the methods described below.
Right to Know (Personal Information Disclosure Request)
You have the right to request twice in a 12-month period that we provide you the categories or specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you; the categories of sources from which we collected your Personal Information; the business or commercial purposes for which we collected, sold, or shared your Personal Information; the categories of Personal Information we disclosed to Service Providers or third parties for a business purpose and the categories of Service Providers and third parties to whom we disclosed it; and the categories of third parties to whom we sold/shared your Personal Information and the categories of Personal Information sold/shared to each category of third party. We cannot provide access to specific pieces of Personal Information if the Personal Information is sensitive or creates a high risk of potential harm from disclosure to an unauthorized person. To protect your Personal Information, we will take steps to validate your identity before any information is disclosed which may require you to provide additional information or documents. We will process verified requests within 45 days, subject to any applicable exceptions and extensions permitted by law. 
Right to Deletion (Delete My Personal Information Request)
You have the right to request that we delete Personal Information we collected about you. Please understand that we are not required to honor a deletion request if a legal exemption applies such as if we need the information to complete a requested or reasonably anticipated transaction, prevent security incidents or fraud, enable internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations, or comply with legal obligations. To protect your Personal Information, we will take steps to validate your identity before your request is processed which may require you to provide additional information or documents. We will process verified requests within 45 days, subject to any applicable exceptions and extensions permitted by law. 
Limit Use of Sensitive Personal Information
Certain states allow you to request that we limit the use of your Sensitive Personal Information to only exempt purposes such as to provide the goods and services you requested, prevent fraud, or verify or maintain the quality or safety of goods or services we provide. Other states may require us to obtain your consent to process Sensitive Personal Information. The definitions of Sensitive Personal Information vary by state. 
We will process requests to limit use of Sensitive Personal Information within 15 business days, subject to any extensions permitted by law. 
If you reside in a state that requires consent to process Sensitive Personal Information, we treat your request to limit as a revocation of consent to process such information. Requests to limit and revocations of consent are subject to exceptions permitted by applicable laws. 
Right to Opt-Out of Automated Decision-making and Profiling
You have the right to direct us not process your data for automated decision making and profiling that produce legal or other similarly significant effects. Although we do not currently conduct such profiling, you may opt-out now to prevent future practices, if any, that qualify. Where permitted by applicable law, we may take steps to validate your identity before your request is processed which may require you to provide additional information or documents. We will process verified requests within 15 business days, such to any applicable exceptions and extensions permitted by law.
Right to Correct
If you believe that your information is inaccurate, you may submit a Correct My Data Request. When you make your request, please be sure to provide us the specific information that you believe is inaccurate and the correct information. You should also provide us with any documentation you believe supports your proposed correction, and we will take that documentation into consideration. We will only correct the information if we determine, based on the totality of the circumstances, that your correction is more likely than not accurate. We may also choose to delete the allegedly inaccurate information instead of correcting it. We will process verified requests within 45 days, subject to any applicable exceptions and extensions permitted by law. 
Right to Appeal
If we deny a previous privacy rights request in full or in part, you have the right to appeal that decision. If we deny your appeal, you may also contact your state Attorney General to lodge a complaint and we may provide you with an online mechanism to do so when we communicate our denial to you.

Frequently Asked Questions 
How would I know if I've enrolled in Subaru Connected Services? How can I find out?
Feel free to call us at 855-753-2495 and we can look that up for you. You can also tell by looking on the MySubaru App in the Subscriptions section. Also, if you did enroll in connected services, then you would have received an enrollment email and invoice from us when you first subscribed to the services.
If I did enroll in Subaru Connected Services, then what data is Subaru collecting from my vehicle?
Subaru will collect vehicle maintenance and diagnostic data; vehicle status data, which may include geolocation data; and data used to carry out user-initiated events, such when you perform a MySubaru Remote command or press the in-vehicle SOS Emergency Assistance button. Please see the Vehicle Privacy Policy for a more detailed list of the data collected.
Does Subaru share the information collected by connected services with anyone else?
Please see our Vehicle Privacy Policy for complete information on how connected services information is shared.
Does Subaru share my driving information with insurance companies?
If you are a current connected services subscriber seeking a quote for insurance, then Subaru will share only your odometer data and only after you provide your direct authorization to the insurance company to access this data. This may be used by your insurance company to make automated decisions regarding your premium. We do not share data with insurance companies unless you provide express consent to those insurance companies. 
What happens if I cancel my connected services subscription? Will my car still work?
Yes, your car will still work. If you cancel connected services, then you will no longer receive connected vehicle features such as Automatic Collision Notification, Enhanced Roadside Assistance, Stolen Vehicle Recovery, or the convenience of remote services. But your car will otherwise operate as normal and you will continue to receive the safety benefits provided by EyeSight, which include Advanced Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Departure & Lane Sway Warnings, Pre-Collision Breaking, and Pre-Collision Throttle Management, and Subaru's DriverFocus system. In addition, you will still enjoy many convenience and entertainment options available with Subaru vehicles, such as in-vehicle navigation, SiriusXM Radio, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto.
How do I ask Subaru to delete my data?
Complete the web form found here. You can also call us at 1-800-SUBARU3.
I'm a victim of domestic abuse and my ex-partner still has access to remote services. How do I disconnect?
Safety is Subaru's top priority. If connected vehicle services are creating a risk to you or your loved ones as a result of a domestic abuser, then please call the Subaru Customer Advocacy Department at 800-782-2783. We will disconnect remote access to the vehicle. (Please note that additional documentation may be required.)
How do I adjust my cookie settings on your website?

CALIFORNIA PRIVACY SUPPLEMENT
FCA US Privacy Policy
Effective Date: July 1, 2024 
FCA US LLC (""FCA US,"" ""we"" or ""us"") is committed to privacy and transparency in our information practices. This FCA US Privacy Policy (our ""Privacy Policy"") describes how we collect, use, disclose, share, and otherwise process the personal information described in this Privacy Policy, as well as the rights and choices individuals have regarding their personal information.
If you are a California resident, please review our California Privacy Supplement for additional information about our privacy practices and your California privacy rights, including your right to opt out of sales and sharing of personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (""CCPA"").
Your access to and use of our Services (as defined below) is subject to our applicable terms and agreements, including the FCA Website Terms of Use, and, as applicable, our App End User License Agreement, the FCA Connected Service Terms of Service, and the SiriusXM Guardian Terms of Services (collectively, the ""Terms""). These Terms are incorporated by reference into this Privacy Policy, including their applicable limitations on liability and the resolution of disputes.
SCOPE
This Privacy Policy applies to our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information related to: our websites (each a ""Website""), mobile applications (each an ""App""), and online services that link to or display this Privacy Policy, and our ""Connected Services"" (as defined and further described in our Connected Services Privacy Notice), as well as the services that FCA makes available to through each of these (collectively, the ""Services"").
This Privacy Policy applies to our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information related to: current and former FCA vehicle owners and Connected Services users.
This Privacy Policy applies to our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information related to: shoppers and prospective purchasers of FCA vehicles, products, and services and other individuals who receive our marketing and promotional communications.
This Privacy Policy applies to our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information related to: participants in contests, promotions, surveys, and other events that we conduct or sponsor.
This Privacy Policy applies to our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information related to: individuals that otherwise contact us or interact with us related to our vehicles, the Services, or our business operations.
This Privacy Policy is intended to describe our overall privacy practices with regard to the personal information subject to this Policy. Our actual collection, use, disclosure, and processing of personal information about individuals will vary depending upon the circumstances.
Additional Privacy Notices and Terms.
We may also provide additional privacy notices (""additional notice"") for specific products, programs, events, promotions, services, features, incentives, or other offers that we provide or make available. For example, the FCA Connected Services Privacy Notice applies to and provides more detail about our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information related to the Connected Services. If you participate in a sweepstake, incentive program, or other promotion, additional privacy terms may apply as set forth in the terms for that promotion. If there is a conflict with the terms of this Privacy Policy and an additional notice, the terms for the promotion will govern with regard to the personal information collected related to that promotion.
Not Covered by this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information by independently owned and operated FCA dealerships and business. In addition, this Privacy Policy does not generally apply to the personal information that we collect about job applicants and candidates, employees, independent contractors, and other workers, or owners and personnel of FCA dealers. If you are a California resident, a different privacy notice (and not this Privacy Policy) applies to our use, disclosure, and processing of such personal information about you.
