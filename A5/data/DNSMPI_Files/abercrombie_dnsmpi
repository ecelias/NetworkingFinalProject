Some of the personal information we collect is considered "sensitive personal information" under California law. We collect the following categories of sensitive personal information (as defined under California law): driver's license, state identification card, or passport number; account log-in credentials, precise geolocation (via our mobile app when you consent to such collection), sexual orientation, and racial or ethnic origin. This information is collected to process transactions, comply with laws, manage our business, or provide you with products and services. Note that we do not use such information for any purposes that are not identified within the California Privacy Rights Act Section 1798.121. We do not "sell" or "share" sensitive personal information for purposes of cross-context targeted advertising.
Data Retention
We will retain your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purposes stated in this Privacy Notice, unless otherwise extending the retention period is required or permitted by law or subject to our retention policies as may be in place from time to time. The data storage period may vary with scenario, product, and service. The standards we use to determine the retention periods include but are not limited to: the time required to retain personal data to fulfill business purposes, including providing products and services; maintaining corresponding transaction and business records; controlling and improving the performance and quality of the website; handling possible user queries or complaints and locating problems; whether the user agrees to a longer retention period; and whether the laws, contracts, and other equivalencies have special requirements for data retention.

California Notice of Financial Incentive
We offer our customers a loyalty program that provides certain perks, such as discounts, rewards and special promotions. We may also provide other programs, such as Inside A&F, sweepstakes, contests, newsletters, or other similar promotional campaigns (collectively, the "Programs"). When you sign up for one of our Programs, we will ask you to provide your name and contact information (such as email address and telephone number). Because our Programs involve the collection of personal information, they might be interpreted as a "financial incentive" program under California law. The value of your personal information to us is related to the value of the free or discounted products or services, or other benefits that you obtain or that are provided as part of the applicable Program.
You may withdraw from participating in a Program at any time by contacting us using the designated method set forth in the applicable Program terms. Visit the terms and conditions page of each Program to view full details, including how to join. To learn more, check out the myAbercrombie terms.
