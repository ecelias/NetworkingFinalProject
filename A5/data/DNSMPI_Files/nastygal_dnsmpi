Notice of Financial Incentives 
Nasty Gal ("we," "our," or "us") is providing you with this notice to explain the material terms of a financial incentive (as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA")) we are offering ( "Incentives") so that you may make an informed decision on whether to participate. 
From time-to time-on certain Websites we may offer a "sign up and save" offer. This means we will provide you with an Incentive (such as a one-time percentage off discount) if you provide us your contact details and agree to receive marketing materials. We also offer various Incentives for registering an account with us, which may include (but not be limited to) discounts on your first order, reduced or free delivery. We may also run competitions which include giveaways which require you to provide us with your contact details to enter. These Incentives may vary from time to time, but will be clearly presented to you at the time you sign up. 
You can take advantage of any Incentives we offer by providing your information where requested, such as entering your email in the box to sign up for marketing communications, entering information of the designated registration page (such as name, date of birth, telephone number, postal address and email address), or in other ways that will be described to you at the time the Incentive is presented. By providing this information, you agree to receive marketing and advertising and that your personal information may be used and shared consistent with our Privacy Notice. 
You can withdraw from the Incentive at any time by emailing us on customerservices@nastygal.com, using the "Contact Us" section on our website, or by unsubscribing to our email marketing by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in the footer of any marketing email received. 
The Incentive is reasonably related to the value of your personal information that you are providing to us. Our good faith estimate of the value of your personal information is the value of the Incentive offered to you (such as the value of the discount code, value of reduced shipping costs or the value of a competition prize or giveaway). We calculated the value of your personal information based on our expenses related to providing the Incentive.
