Program Overview.
The Garage and Dynamite Loyalty Program is a loyalty reward program offered by Groupe Dynamite Inc. (the Loyalty Program). The Loyalty Program allows members to earn Benefits (as defined below) through the purchase of products from the Websites, the Apps, and both the Dynamite and Garage brand stores (the Stores). 
As a member of the Loyalty Program 
The Loyalty Program allows persons who have completed the membership enrollment steps described below (the Members) to earn points (the Points) when making purchases in-store, online, and through the Apps and, engaging with the Dynamite and Garage communities, and to redeem these Points for rebates or cash-off or other experiences or products offered by GDI from time to time (the Rewards) as well as have access to exclusive offers, events, and promotions which may be offered by GDI from time to time (the Offers, and collectively with the Points and the Rewards, the Benefits). 
In order to accumulate Points and redeem for Offers and Rewards, you must be a Member in good standing. The accumulation of Benefits does not entitle Members to any vested rights and, in accumulating Benefits, Members may not rely upon the continued availability of any Benefit or the continued existence of any aspect of the Loyalty Program. Changes to any of these matters may affect the Benefits that a member has already accumulated, as well as any future accumulation of any Benefits. 
GDI specifically reserves the right to withdraw or terminate the Loyalty Program upon sixty days' notice. By enrolling in the Loyalty Program, you agree to these Terms and you consent to the collection and use of your personal information in accordance with the GDI Privacy Policy (Privacy Policy), the terms of which are hereby incorporated by reference. 
Becoming a Member:
Membership is free and no initial purchase is required in order to become a Member. To enroll, you must have a valid Canadian or US address and be 14 years of age or older. Only one Loyalty Program account (the "Account") is permitted per person. GDI reserves the right to request proof of eligibility at any time. 
If you were enrolled in GDI's Studio Loyalty Program prior to the launch of the new Collectif program and you shopped with us in the last 24 months before the launch, you will be automatically enrolled in the Collectif Loyalty Program, but may terminate your membership in the Loyalty Program at any time by logging in to your Account on the Apps or by contacting our Customer Experience team via email or by calling 1-888-882-1138. 
To become a Member, you may use one of the following methods: the Apps: Download one of the Apps and create an Account using a valid email address and password.
To become a Member, you may use one of the following methods: the Websites: Create an Account in the Loyalty Program section of either the Dynamite or Garage Websites using a valid email address and password.
To become a Member, you may use one of the following methods: in-Store: Sign up to the Loyalty Program in-store by providing a valid email address and accepting the Terms and Conditions, at the point of sale. You will then be advised to activate your Account and create a password by clicking on a link provided with the activation email you will receive thereafter. If you do not create a password at the point of sale, your loyalty membership will still be valid to use in-store.
Members cannot share their Account number and Account information with anyone else. Benefits apply only to the individual Member and are non-transferable. Account information, including, but not limited to, the Account password, should be protected by the Member and kept secure. 
You must advise us immediately of any changes to your personal information, including name, address, and email address (the Personal Information) by using the Websites or the Apps to update the information contained in the "My Profile" section of your Account. GDI shall not be liable for misdirected email or mail communications, including any notices under these Terms or any consequences thereof where your Personal Information is inaccurate or no longer valid.

We reserve the right to refuse to issue, cancel or close any Account, without notice, for which we have incomplete or inaccurate Personal Information. All Benefits associated with such Account may be blocked and any such Benefits may be forfeited and cancelled. The submission of false or fictitious Personal Information will result in all the Benefits accumulated on an Account being forfeited and cancelled. 
Accumulation of Points:
Members can accumulate Points through the purchase of products on the Websites, the Apps, and the Stores. For every $1 spent, you will earn 1 Point. Note: Applicable after all discounts, and before taxes and shipping fees. CAD and USD purchases are valued at the same amount ($1 CAD = $1 USD with no exchange rate difference). From time to time, Members will also be given the opportunity to earn Points by performing non-transactional activities with Dynamite and Garage, such as downloading the Apps, subscribing to our newsletters, etc. 
The Loyalty Program has three separate Membership Levels. You can move up through the different levels by earning more Points. 
Creator is for Members with 0, 299 Points. 
Muse is for Members with 300, 599 Points. 
Icon is for Members with 600 Points or more. 
All earned Points are stored in your "Rewards" in the Apps and in the "My Rewards" section of the Websites. 
GDI's standard Return/Exchange Policy applies returns: If you return purchased items, the Points earned by those items will be deducted from your total Points. Note: you will not be required to re-earn or reimburse any Points that have already been redeemed for Rewards.
GDI's standard Return/Exchange Policy applies exchanges: There is no impact for exchanges of the same value. If the item is exchanged for a higher valued item, you will earn Points on any additional spend. If the item is exchanged for a lower value item, then the difference will be deducted from your total Points.
GDI's standard Return/Exchange Policy applies upon the return and exchange of Products obtained through the redemption of Rewards, all redeemed Rewards will be forfeited, and the Member will receive only the cash price paid, if any, for the returned product.
Redemption of Rewards: 
Members can view Points for Rewards in their "Rewards" in the Apps and in the "My Rewards" section of the Websites. Rewards can be redeemed at checkout on the Websites and on the Apps, as well as in Stores at the point of sale. Note: Certain Rewards (i.e., redeem for cash) can be redeemed at any time throughout the year whereas others will be more time limited (i.e., limited-edition sweatshirt). 
Every 150 Points redeemed equals $5 cash back
Every 300 Points redeemed equals $10 cash back
Every 450 Points redeemed equals $15 cash back

Varying number of Points for experiences and products offered by GDI from time to time.

You can, however, combine your Reward with another member offer, such as your birthday gift, and more. Total purchases must be at least $1 more than the rebate value. If a Reward is redeemed, Points will be earned only on the net purchase amount of any Reward value, sales, or value-added taxes and shipping costs.

The Notice of Dispute must include the name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address of the person or entity providing the notice; a statement of the legal claims asserted and the factual basis for those claims; and a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good-faith calculation of the amount in controversy. 
If you provide a Notice of Dispute to GDI, the Notice of Dispute must be mailed via first-class mail, FedEx, or UPS to: GDI, ATTN: Legal Department, 5592 Ferrier St, Mount Royal, Quebec H4P 1M2. Your Notice of Dispute must include your personal signature. If GDI provides you a Notice of Dispute, GDI will mail the notice via first-class mail, FedEx, or UPS to the billing address associated with your Account and billing information (the Notice Address). If GDI is unable to reach you at the Notice Address, it may provide a Notice of Dispute to you via email at the email address associated with your Account. 
If requested by the party that receives the Notice of Dispute, the other party must personally appear at and participate in a telephone settlement conference (if a party is represented by counsel, counsel may also participate) to discuss the Dispute. 
For a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of a complete Notice of Dispute, you and GDI agree to make attempts to resolve the Dispute prior to commencing an arbitration and not to commence an arbitration proceeding until the 60-day post-notice resolution period expires, which period may be extended by agreement of the parties. If an agreement cannot be reached within 60 days of receipt of the Notice of Dispute, you or GDI may commence an arbitration proceeding, pursuant to the procedure outlined below. Compliance with and completing this informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent to filing any formal dispute resolution proceeding, including a demand for arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process. 
If the sufficiency of a Notice of Dispute or compliance with this mandatory informal dispute resolution process is at issue, it may be decided by the court of competent jurisdiction at either party's request, and any formal dispute resolution proceeding shall be stayed pending resolution of the issue. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce this condition precedent to arbitration, which includes the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of a demand for arbitration or the assessment or payment of arbitration fees. You or we may also elect to raise non-compliance with this informal dispute resolution process and seek relief in arbitration. 
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE THROUGH THE INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS, DISAGREEMENTS, DISPUTES, OR CONTROVERSIES BETWEEN YOU AND ANY GDI PARTIES, AND THEIR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, PARENTS, AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES, AND/OR RELATED COMPANIES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SITES, TO THE USE OR ACCESS THEREOF, TO THE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, MATERIALS, PROMOTIONS, PROGRAMS OR OTHER FEATURES OFFERED ON OR THROUGH THE SITES, AND/OR TO THE APPLICATION, ENFORCEABILITY, SCOPE, OR INTERPRETATION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (DISPUTES), SHALL BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION. THE SOLE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS REQUIREMENT ARE THAT YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY, AS LONG AS THE MATTER REMAINS IN SUCH COURT AND IS NOT REMOVED OR APPEALED TO A COURT OF GENERAL JURISDICTION AND ADVANCES ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NON-REPRESENTATIVE BASIS); AND EACH PARTY MAY BRING SUIT IN COURT TO ENJOIN INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER MISUSE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. DISPUTE WILL BE GIVEN THE BROADEST POSSIBLE MEANING PERMITTED BY LAW. IT INCLUDES CLAIMS THAT AROSE BEFORE THIS OR ANY PRIOR AGREEMENT OR THAT ARISE AFTER THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO BRING AND PROSECUTE ANY DISPUTES WITH GDI IN A COURT OF LAW OR BEFORE A JURY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN OR BRING CLASS ACTIONS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS. 
ALL DISPUTES SHALL BE DETERMINED BY BINDING ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED BY AAA OR THE CAA, PURSUANT TO THE AAA OR CAA CONSUMER ARBITRATION RULES AND AS MODIFIED BY THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE; CONDUCTED BY A SINGLE, NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR; AND TAKE PLACE TELEPHONICALLY UNLESS AN IN-PERSON HEARING IS SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED BY EITHER PARTY. IF AN IN-PERSON HEARING IS REQUESTED, SUCH IN-PERSON HEARINGS SHALL TAKE PLACE IN THE COUNTY OF THE BILLING ADDRESS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR ACCOUNT, OR THE COUNTY OR DISTRICT WHERE YOU RESIDE, IN THE INSTANCE WHERE NO ACCOUNT EXISTS. TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE CONFLICTS WITH THE AAA OR CAA POLICY ON CONSUMER ARBITRATIONS PURSUANT TO PRE-DISPUTE CLAUSES MINIMUM STANDARDS OF PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS (THE MINIMUM STANDARDS), THE MINIMUM STANDARD IN THAT REGARD WILL APPLY. You and a GDI representative shall personally appear (with counsel if you and we are represented) at an initial telephone conference with a case manager before an arbitrator is appointed and at a hearing should one be scheduled by the arbitrator. 
DISPUTES MAY ALSO BE REFERRED TO ANOTHER ARBITRATION ORGANIZATION IF YOU AND GDI AGREE IN WRITING, OR TO AN ARBITRATOR APPOINTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 5 OF THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT (US). IF YOU ARE A CANADIAN RESIDENT, ALL REFERENCES HEREIN TO THE AAA SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE REFERENCES TO THE CANADIAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (CAA), MAKING THE APPROPRIATE CORRESPONDING CHANGES. 
The AAA Rules are available on its website or by calling AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The CAA Rules are available on its website or by calling CAA at 1-800-856-5154. To commence an arbitration, a Demand for Arbitration is required to be executed and served on GDI. Service of the Demand for Arbitration on GDI can be mailed to GDI Legal Department, 5592 Ferrier St, Mount Royal, Quebec H4P 1M2, pursuant to the instructions provided by AAA or CAA to submit a Dispute for arbitration. Service of the Demand for Arbitration on you will be sent to the Notice Address. Further instructions on submitting a Demand for Arbitration can be found at website_url_lnk (for the AAA) and at website_url_lnk (for the CAA). 
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. An arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms. 
Except as expressly provided in this Dispute Resolution section, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, provincial or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Dispute Resolution section including, but not limited to, a claim that all or any part of it is void or voidable. The parties shall be responsible for their own attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration, unless they are authorized by law, or the arbitrator determines that a claim was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or in bad faith. For US Citizens, the arbitrator shall have the authority under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 to issue sanctions against any party and counsel as a court would. In addition, the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 shall apply and be enforced by the arbitrator. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, GDI will pay all fees and costs that we are required by law to pay. 
YOU AND WE VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU OR WE HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL. 
SPECIAL ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES FOR MASS ARBITRATION. If twenty-five or more similar claims are asserted against GDI by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated (and your claim is one such claim), you understand and agree that the resolution of your Dispute might be delayed. You also agree to the following process. Counsel for the claimants and counsel for GDI shall each select ten cases (per side) to proceed first in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process. The remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the initial twenty proceedings, the parties shall participate in a global mediation session before a retired Quebec Superior Court or federal court judge, and GDI shall pay the mediator's fee. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining matters in mediation at this time, each side shall select twenty cases (per side) to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a second bellwether process. (If there are fewer than forty claims remaining, all shall proceed.) The remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any fees be assessed in connection with those cases until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. A single arbitrator shall preside over each case. Only one case may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of a bellwether process unless the parties agree otherwise. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the forty proceedings, the parties shall participate in another global mediation session before a retired Quebec Superior Court or federal court judge, and GDI shall pay the mediator's fee. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining matters in mediation at this time, this staged process shall continue with one hundred (100) cases proceeding at one time that are selected randomly or by the relevant Arbitration Association (AAA or CAA) in staged sets, until all the claims included in these coordinated filings, including your case, are adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Between staged sets of proceedings, GDI agrees to participate in a global mediation session should your counsel request it in an effort to resolve all remaining claims. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for claims subject to this Dispute Resolution section where a Notice of Dispute or Demand for Arbitration has been submitted, from the time the first cases are selected for a bellwether process until the time your case is selected, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this paragraph and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing or prosecution of arbitration demands against GDI. Should a court of competent jurisdiction decline to enforce these "Special Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration," you and we agree that your and our counsel shall engage in good faith with the assistance of a Process Arbitrator to devise and implement procedures that ensure that arbitration remains efficient and cost-effective for all parties. Either party may engage with the relevant Arbitration Association (AAA or CAA) to address reductions in arbitration fees. 
NO CLASS ACTIONS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED INDIVIDUALLY, WITHOUT RESORT TO ANY FORM OF CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. NEITHER YOU NOR WE SHALL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION OR ARBITRATE ANY DISPUTE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. Further, unless both you and GDI expressly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claim and the arbitrator may not otherwise preside over any form of a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general proceeding. 
If a court determines that any of the prohibitions on non-individualized relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief), and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted (or the decision is otherwise final), then the parties agree that that particular claim or request for relief may proceed in court but shall be stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims. Specifically, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section (Dispute Resolution), the arbitrator may not issue a "public injunction" and any such "public injunction," if permitted, may be awarded only by the Superior court of Quebec. If either party is permitted to seek a "public injunction," all other claims and prayers for relief must be adjudicated in arbitration first and any such prayer or claim for a "public injunction" in federal or provincial court stayed until the arbitration is completed, after which the federal or state court can adjudicate the party's claim or prayer for "public injunctive relief." In doing so, the federal or provincial court is bound under principles of claim or issue preclusion by the decision of the arbitrator. If this prohibition of class, representative, or consolidated arbitration is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. 
Except as specifically provided in this section (i.e., the Additional Procedures for Mass Filings), if any part or parts of the mandatory informal dispute resolution process, arbitration agreement, class action waiver, is/are found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable as to your Dispute, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, and the remainder of this section shall continue in full force and effect. The mandatory informal dispute resolution process, arbitration agreement, and class action waiver will survive the termination of these terms.
