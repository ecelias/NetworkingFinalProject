VALENTINO US reserves therefore the right not to process orders placed by persons other than the "consumer" or, in any case, orders that are not consistent with its business policy. 
You agree that your order is an offer to buy, under these Terms, all products and services listed in your order.

You have the option to cancel your order at any time before we have sent your order confirmation email by contacting our Customer Service Department.
How to Purchase the Products
The products offered for sale by VALENTINO US are only those displayed on the Website when the Order is placed. 
It is understood that, since the images included on the Website are provided for information purposes only and may not be representative of all of the specifications of the product, colors and sizes may differ because of differences in screens and systems used by Customers when accessing the Website.
Customer may place an order on the Website in accordance with the instructions provided on the Website, after having carefully reviewed these Terms, the product specifications, the relevant price (inclusive of all applicable taxes and charges), shipping costs (including the additional costs that may be incurred in case a shipping and delivery method that is quicker and different from the standard one is chosen). Customer may also opt to receive an invoice for the product. 
VALENTINO US shall confirm that the Order has been received by sending an email to the address provided by Customer. The email shall contain a short description of the conditions of purchase, as well as the information provided by the Customer on the Website. This will allow Customer to verify that such information is correct and, if necessary, immediately report any incorrect data. 
Prices and Payment Terms 
The prices indicated on the Website are inclusive of taxes. Customer shall be informed in advance of shipping costs or fees, if any, through the Website. 
The payments can be made only by credit card and the transaction will be processed through a secure server selected by VALENTINO US.
Under no circumstances and at no stage of the payment process, will the details of the credit card of Customer be disclosed to VALENTINO US. Such details will be directly sent, in a secure manner, to the website of the financial institution in charge of the transaction. Since none of such data will be stored in VALENTINO US's files, VALENTINO US will not be liable for fraudulent and unlawful uses, if any, made by third parties of the Customer's credit card during the payment procedure.
Shipping and Delivery of the Products 
We will arrange for shipment of the products to you. Please check the individual product page for specific delivery options. You will pay all shipping and handling charges specified during the ordering process.

Customer will need to show a copy of the email and a valid form of ID. Failure to collect the product within the time limit indicated shall result in the purchase agreement being automatically terminated and Customer being entitled to obtain a full refund of the price. Since no payment can be made at the retail store, cash on delivery is not applicable to products purchased according to such procedure. 
The delivery times indicated by VALENTINO US are purely indicative. Any delays, or partial deliveries, shall not entitle Customer to reject the product and claim compensations or indemnities.
