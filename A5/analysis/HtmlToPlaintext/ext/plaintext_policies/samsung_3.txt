Samsung Care, Benefit. Program members are entitled to receive Samsung Care+ coverage in the form of a Samsung Care+ plan for eligible products, which must be added at the point of product purchase on samsung.com or the Shop App. Products not purchased on samsung.com or the Shop App or purchased prior to the date of your enrollment in the Samsung Advantage VIP Membership Program are not eligible for the above VIP program Samsung Care+ benefits. Upon acceptance of the relevant Samsung Care+ plan in connection with each qualifying product purchase, the Samsung Care+ plan will continue for up to two years (1 year Samsung's manufacturer's warranty, 1 year extended warranty by Assurant or Servify) following the relevant Samsung Care+ plan coverage start date, provided that your Samsung Care+ plan is not cancelled according to its terms. SamsungCare+ with Theft and Loss insurance is not included but may be purchased separately on certain mobile products. Please note that all Samsung Care+ plans will be established in the name of the primary membership account holder if the eligible product purchase transaction is validly identified by the purchaser as being associated with a Program membership, even in cases where you purchased an eligible product (to which a Samsung Care+ plan attached) for someone else as a gift.
Plan Terms and Conditions. The complete, current terms and conditions for Samsung Care+ plan can be found at Samsung Care+ Terms and Conditions
[website_url_lnk
[website_url_lnk For clarity, when you make a product purchase that is eligible for the Samsung Care+ plan, the then-current version of the terms and conditions for Samsung Care+ will apply and govern the Samsung Care+ Terms coverage for such eligible product, including any updated coverage, pricing and service fees. While your Program membership is active, if you voluntarily purchase a different customer-paid service contract (e.g., a multi-year, one-time-pay plan) on a product that would have been eligible for the Samsung Care+ plan under your Program membership, any claims and coverage on that product must be processed under that separately-paid service contract and not through your Program membership.

Limitation of Liability
Samsung, and its parent, subsidiary, affiliate, franchisees, and related companies, and each of its and their respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents and promotional and advertising agencies, successors, assigns (collectively the "Released Parties") are not responsible for any printing or computer error, omission, interruption, irregularity, deletion, defect, delay in operations or transmission, theft or destruction or unauthorized access to or alteration of Program materials or for technical, network, telephone equipment, electronic, computer, hardware or software malfunctions of any kind, or inaccurate transmission of Program information due to technical problems or traffic congestion on the internet, at any web site or any combination thereof. In the event that Samsung.com, the Shop Samsung App, the Pay App and the Program is temporarily corrupted or suspended, notice of such will be provided and Participants will be advised to that purchases during this time period completed will not generate Program benefits for the Participant.
By participating in the Program, each Participant accepts all responsibility for, and hereby releases and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Samsung and their respective parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, promotion and advertising agencies, including, franchisees, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, and successors, assigns, and service providers from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, or expenses that may arise from actions taken by such Participant and Participant's participation in the Program, or for any harm or injury caused by any third party.
IN NO EVENT SHALL RELEASED PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS, EVEN IF ANY OR ALL OF THE FOREGOING OR ANY OF THEIR AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS MEANS THAT PARTICIPANT HEREBY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS FROM SAMSUNG AND ITS LICENSORS. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, SAMSUNG'S CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO PARTICIPANT ARISING FROM ANY CAUSE OF ACTION WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF YOUR ACTUAL LOSS; OR $1,000.

Dispute Resolution Agreement
These Terms and Conditions include a binding Dispute Resolution Agreement, which includes an arbitration provision. The Dispute Resolution Agreement can be found at website_url_lnk and is incorporated herein. Please review the Dispute Resolution Agreement carefully. It affects your rights. There is a limited 30 day right to opt out of the arbitration provision. If a dispute cannot be resolved through the mandatory informal dispute resolution process (which includes a telephone settlement conference, if requested), Samsung and its customers agree to address the dispute through binding individual arbitration (unless customers have timely opted out of the provision) or in small claims court where the customers reside. Class and representative proceedings are not allowed. In arbitration, a neutral decision maker (called an arbitrator) will hear both sides of a dispute and issue a binding decision. There is no judge or jury in arbitration and the arbitrator applies the same law and can award the same individual remedies as a court. The procedures are streamlined in arbitration, including less discovery and appellate review, to help ensure dispute resolution is less burdensome and more cost-effective for everyone. 
If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be severed from the remainder of these Terms and Conditions, which will otherwise remain in full force and effect.
Limitations of Service.
We shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to any cause beyond our control. We may refrain from providing services under your Program membership, wholly or in part, on the basis that the minimum system requirements are not met or if your technical needs or other requirements are unusual or extensive and beyond the scope of these Terms and Conditions, as determined by us.
