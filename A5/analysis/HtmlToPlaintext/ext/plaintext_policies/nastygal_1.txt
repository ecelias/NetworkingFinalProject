The images of the Products on Our Site and in our other advertising materials are for illustrative purposes only. Your Products may vary slightly from those images. Although we have made every effort to display and print the colors of the Products accurately, we cannot guarantee that your device or computer's display of the pictures, or the pictures in our other advertising materials, accurately reflect the colors of the Products that will be delivered to you. The Products may vary slightly from these images.
Whilst we take reasonable care to ensure accuracy, all sizing and measurements of Products detailed on Our Site are approximate. We cannot guarantee that all details are always accurate, complete, or error free.
All our Products are sold on the basis that they are suitable for domestic and private use only. As such, none of our Products are intended for use in connection with any business purpose.
Please note that Products on Our Site are not aimed at persons aged under 16 and may be unsuitable for persons under this age group. We do not sell Products to children, but sell them to adults over 18 years old, who can purchase products with a credit card, debit card, or other payment method.
PRODUCT AVAILABILITY
Some restrictions are placed on the extent to which we accept orders from specific countries. These restrictions can be found on our "Deliveries" page here.
If we are unable to accept your order, we will inform you of this and will not charge you for the Products. This may happen in circumstances, including (but not limited to) where the Products is/are out of stock, because of unexpected limits on our resources which we could not reasonably plan for, or because we have identified an error in the price or description of the Products.
We may make changes to these Terms and Conditions from time to time. The Terms and Conditions that apply to your Contract (as defined in Section 6.2) will be those that are displayed on Our Site when you place your order.

HOW THE CONTRACT IS FORMED BETWEEN YOU AND US
Once you have placed your order, you should receive an e-mail from us acknowledging that we have received your order (but please contact us if you do not receive this e-mail). Please note this does not mean that your order has been accepted or that a contract has been formed between you and us. All orders are subject to availability and acceptance by us (which we may refuse for any reason).
After you submit your order, we immediately contact your bank or card issuer for authorization to take payment from your account. We will not process your order until payment has been received in full. If we accept your order we will confirm this to you by sending you a further e-mail ("Dispatch Confirmation") confirming the Product is being processed ready for dispatch at which point the contract between you and us ("Contract") will be formed.
As soon as you place your order, we start to process your order which means you will not be able to change it before delivery, but you may be able to return your Products under our Returns Policy here
From time to time we may make minor changes to a Product to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements. If these changes change the product description or other mandatory information to be provided to you under the applicable laws, we will update Our Site.
These Terms and Conditions, and any Contract between us, are only in the English language. Please note that we may not necessarily keep a copy of your Contract. You should keep a copy of these Terms and Conditions and your order for future reference.
DELIVERY
We will seek to fulfil your order by the delivery date set out in the Dispatch Confirmation or, if no delivery date is specified, then as soon as reasonably possible (depending on the delivery service you have selected). In any event, delivery will take place no more than 30 days after the day your Contract is entered into.
If no one is available at your address to take delivery and the Products cannot be posted through your mailbox or left in a safe place and if you do not collect the Products from an address notified to you by our carrier within the time period notified to you by our carrier at the time delivery is attempted, we may end the Contract and Section 10 will apply.
Delivery of your order will be complete when we deliver the Products to the address you gave us and the Products will be your responsibility from that time
If you check out using your bank details, Paypal, or Apple Pay, you will own the Products once we have received payment in full. However, when you check-out using a payment instalment method, e.g., through a finance provider such as Klarna, then alternative terms will apply to you, further information on this is set out in Section 8 below.
Please note zipcode and postcode restrictions apply. Delivery times and costs may be increased where the Products are shipped outside the United States. Check your eligibility here
If you wish to dispute delivery of your order, you have 28 days starting from the day that the tracking status for you order is updated by the carrier as fulfilled (i.e. updated as delivered to the address set out in the Dispatch Confirmation). If your tracking doesn't confirm your order has been delivered please note you have 90 days from your last tracking event to contact us. We reserve the right to request evidence, before issuing any refund of the price paid and any associated delivery costs.
In addition, if you order Products from us for delivery to a destination outside the United States your order may be subject to import duties and taxes which are applied when it reaches the delivery destination. Please note that we have no control over these charges and we cannot predict their amount. You will be responsible for payment of any such import duties and taxes. Please contact your local customs office for further information before placing your order. We will not be liable or responsible if you do not pay any such import duties or taxes; 
In addition, if you order Products from us for delivery to a destination outside the United States you must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the United States and any country for which the Products are destined. We will not be liable or responsible if you break any such law; 
In addition, if you order Products from us for delivery to a destination outside the United States please see our Returns Policy here for details on returning any Products to us from a destination outside the United States.
PRICE AND PAYMENT
The price payable for the Products shall be as shown on Our Site in United States Dollars (USD), although please see Section below for what happens if we discover an error in the price of any Product you order.
If you are viewing Our Site from the UK or a country in the EU, the Product prices advertised on Our Site for Products located in the EU are inclusive of the UK VAT at the relevant rate chargeable for the time being. Additional delivery charges (which will include UK VAT charged by us) will vary depending on the Products you ordered and your delivery address and are shown separately during the checkout process.
We reserve the right to change the prices on Our Site at any time without notice, but changes will not affect orders which we have already accepted. However, if applicable, the rate of VAT changes after the date of your order, we will adjust the rate of VAT you pay unless you have already paid for the Products in full before the change in VAT takes effect.
Taxes that appear in your online order confirmation are estimated. Because orders may be fulfilled from multiple locations across the U. S., the actual taxes charged to your credit card will be calculated based on the applicable state and local sales taxes when your order is shipped. We do not collect sales or use taxes in all states. For states imposing sales or use taxes, your purchase may be subject to use tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation. Your purchase is not exempt merely because it is made over the Internet or by other remote means. Many states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return at the end of the year reporting all of the taxable purchases that were not taxed and to pay tax on those purchases. Details of how to report these taxes may be found at the websites of your respective taxing authorities.
We accept payment by debit card, credit card, Apple Pay (iOS only), PayPal, Afterpay and Klarna. We accept the following cards: Visa, VISA Electron, Mastercard, Maestro, American Express.
You must pay for the Products (including all applicable delivery charges), and we will charge the card you have chosen to use to pay for your order once you reach the final billing page and submit your order. We immediately contact your bank or card issuer for authorization to take payment from your account. If you pay using any third-party service provider, such payments are subject to the third-party service provider's terms and conditions. If you pay using Klarna, such payment will subject to additional terms between you and Klarna, available at website_url_lnk website_url_lnk for further information about Klarna. For more information about how Klarna will handle your personal data see their Privacy Policy, available at website_url_lnk
It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products we sell may be incorrectly priced. We have the right to reject an order if we discover a pricing error. We will normally check prices before accepting your order and if the price is incorrect, we will try to contact you for your instructions before we accept your order. If we are unable to contact you, your order will be cancelled. If we accept and process your order where there is a pricing error that is obvious and unmistakable and which could reasonably have been recognized by you as a mispricing, we may end the Contract, refund to you any sums you have paid under the Contract and require the return of any Products provided to you.
If you wish to apply a discount code or e-gift voucher code to your order, you must enter the relevant code during the online checkout process. Only one discount code and a maximum of five e-gift voucher codes, can be used per order and additional terms and conditions may apply in respect of each discount code. We reserve the right to decline to accept any discount or e-gift voucher code that is invalid for your order or that has expired.
Our percentage off promotions, discounts, or sale markdowns are customarily based on our own opinion of the value of this product, which is not intended to reflect a former price at which this product has sold in the recent past. This amount represents our opinion of the full retail value of this product today based on our own assessment after considering a number of factors. That's why before checking out, it's important you acknowledge that you understand this.

Jury Trial & Class Action Waiver
YOU AND NASTY GAL ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.

("FAA"), will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section 19. If the FAA is found not to apply to any issue that arises under this section or the enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the State of Delaware. The arbitration will be conducted under the then current and applicable consumer arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The AAA rules are available online at website_url_lnk or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
Informal Dispute Resolution
You and Nasty Gal agree to try and resolve any dispute informally before resorting to arbitration. You and Nasty Gal therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer either via telephone or video call in a good faith effort to resolve informally any dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement ("Informal Dispute Resolution Conference"). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference but you will also participate in the conference. The Party initiating the dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference ("Notice") which shall occur within 45 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to Nasty Gal that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent via email to legal@boohoo.com or regular mail to 49/51 Dale Street, Manchester, M1 2HF. Notice to you will be sent to the address or email address associated with your account. The Notice must include your name, telephone number, mailing address, e-mail address associated with your account, the name, telephone number, mailing address and email address of your counsel, if any; and a description of your Dispute. The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualised such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm, or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a conditions precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute resolution Conference required by this section.
Initiating Arbitration
Prior to initiating an arbitration, a party must first send a further written notice to the other party. If you intend to seek arbitration you must first send notice by international mail to Nasty Gal UK Limited, c/o Legal Team, 49/51 Dale Street, Manchester, M1 2HF England. The notice shall be individual and not for the claims of any other person, and must include your full name, your entire factual, legal claim, the requested relief and an express authorization to bring the arbitration demand. Nasty Gal shall send a Notice to the current billing address on your account by international mail. The Notice shall describe the nature and basis of the claim and the specific relief sought. If the parties cannot reach a settlement within 30 days from the receipt of the Notice, either party may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form to initiate arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA site at website_url_lnk In addition to filing this form with the AAA, the party initiating the arbitration must post a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send such copy to Nasty Gal at Nasty Gal Limited, c/o Legal Team, 49/51 Dale Street, Manchester, M1 2HF England, and Nasty Gal will send such copy to the current billing address or email address on your account or to your counsel, if you so instruct.
Fees
You will pay the individual portion of the arbitration filing fee specified in the rules of the AAA. Nasty Gal will pay the business portion of the required filing fees, and all administration and arbitrator fees (collectively, your and Nasty Gal 's fees, "Arbitration Fees").
Location & Procedure
If your claim is for $10,000 (US Dollars) or less, you may choose to have arbitration conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, via a telephone hearing, by an in-person hearing in the county of your residence, or as otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties. If your claim exceeds $10,000 (US Dollars), the location of the arbitration and the parties' right to a hearing will be determined in accordance with the rules of the AAA.
Arbitrator's Decision
The arbitrator's award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. If you prevail in arbitration, you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Nasty Gal shall have the right to seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration for claims deemed frivolous by the arbitrator. If Nasty Gal makes an offer of judgment not less than 10 days prior to the arbitration, if an arbitrator's monetary award against Nasty Gal does not match or exceed Nasty Gal 's offer, you agree to pay Nasty Gal 's legal fees and expenses for the arbitration.
Choice of Law, Forum Selection, & Jury Waiver
Except as set forth in this Section 19, all matters relating to all matters arising out of or related to these Terms & Conditions of Sale, will be governed by the applicable laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to Delaware choice of law principles. Unless you and Nasty Gal agree otherwise, in the event that it is determined or these Terms & Conditions of Sale provide that a claim should not proceed through arbitration, you agree that any claim or dispute (with the exception of a claim or dispute appropriately lodged in any small claims court in the United States of America) shall be resolved in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, and you submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court. If subject matter jurisdiction (including diversity jurisdiction) does not exist in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for any such claim, then the exclusive forum and venue for any such action shall be the courts of the State of Delaware located in New Castle County, and you submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court. As to any proceeding in court, you and Nasty Gal both waive your right to a jury trial, unless such waiver is unenforceable. The choice-of-law and forum-selection provisions in this section do not apply to the Arbitration Agreement or to any arbitrable disputes as provided by the Arbitration Agreement section. Instead, as provided in the Arbitration Agreement section, the FAA shall apply to any such disputes.
The choice-of-law and forum-selection provisions in this section do not apply to the Arbitration Agreement or to any arbitrable disputes as provided by the Arbitration Agreement section. Instead, as provided in the Arbitration Agreement section, the FAA shall apply to any such disputes.
Class Action Waiver
You acknowledge and agree that any and all disputes, claims, or controversies between the parties shall be resolved only in individual arbitration. You expressly waive the right to have any dispute, claim, or controversy brought, heard, administered, resolved, or arbitrated as a class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, and representative action, and neither an arbitrator nor an arbitration provider shall have any authority to hear, arbitrate, or administer any class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, and representative action, or to award relief to anyone but the individual in arbitration ("Class Action Waiver"). The parties also expressly waive the right to seek, recover, or obtain any non-individual relief. Notwithstanding anything else in this agreement, this Class Action Waiver does not prevent you or Nasty Gal from participating in a classwide, collective, and representative settlement of claims as set out in Section 19.14. The parties further agree that if for any reason a claim does not proceed in arbitration, this Class Action Waiver shall remain in effect, and a court may not preside over any action joining, coordinating, or consolidating the claims of multiple individuals against Nasty Gal in a single proceeding, except that this Class Action Waiver shall not prevent you or Nasty Gal from participating in a classwide, collective, and representative settlement of claims as set out in 19.14. If it is determined that any portion of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, any class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, and representative claims subject to the unenforceable or unlawful portions shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction; the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration; the unenforceable or unlawful portions shall be severed from this Arbitration Agreement; and severance of the unenforceable or unlawful portions shall have no impact whatsoever on the enforceability, applicability, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or the arbitrability of any remaining claims asserted by you or Nasty Gal.
Batching
If 100 of more customers initiate Notices of dispute (including Informal Dispute Resolution) with Nasty Gal raising similar claims within a 30 day period and counsel for the Nasty Gal customers bringing the claims are the same, or coordinated with these customers, the claims shall proceed in arbitration in a coordinated proceeding. Counsel for You and counsel for Nasty Gal shall each select 5 cases to proceed first in arbitration in a bellwether proceeding ("Bellwether Proceeding"). The remaining cases shall not be filed in arbitration until the first 10 have been resolved. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the Bellwether Proceeding, each side may select another 5 cases to proceed to arbitration for a second Bellwether Proceeding. This process may continue until the parties are able to resolve all of the claims either through settlement or arbitration. A court will have authority to enforce this clause and if necessary to enjoin the mass filing of arbitration demands against Nasty Gal. 
An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case; it cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award itself. 
If for some reason the prohibition on class arbitrations as set out above cannot be enforced as to all or part of the dispute then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply to that dispute or part of the dispute. 
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, such as pursuant to Section 19.3. You and Nasty Gal agree that there will not be a jury trial. You and Nasty Gal unconditionally waive any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counter claim arising out of or relating to this Arbitration Agreement in any way. In the event of litigation, this Section may be filed to show a written consent to a trial by the court.
