The Vehicle Details feature may allow you to access certain information related to your vehicle via FordPass. In order to register your car with the Vehicle Details feature, you will need to input your VIN number. By registering your vehicle with Vehicle Details you expressly opt-in to receiving notifications, including email, as well as other communications from us related to the My Vehicle feature. If you wish to opt-out of these communications, please contact Ford Guides through FordPass or stop using the Vehicle Details feature by changing your preferences in the settings menu of FordPass.

Parking 
Parking-related services are limited to informing you of the location and potential availability of parking, and (for certain parking locations, as indicated) enabling you to reserve and pay for parking. We may use third parties to provide these services. We do not, however, sell parking, provide a parking service, operate a parking lot, or otherwise accept custody of motor vehicles. These services are provided by others, such as parking facility owners or operators, and they are in no way our agent or acting on our behalf. 
You will be required to set up accounts with third party operators to reserve and pay for parking. 
Parking rates are set directly by the parking owner or operator, not us. Reserved rates may differ from drive-up rates (if available), and may be subject to change. You are responsible for paying the actual rates for all parking, including any costs for parking in excess of your booked time. 
You are responsible for selecting your parking and compliance with all signs, laws, and regulations relating to parking. You also are responsible for compliance with the agreement with the operator of the parking facility as posted at the location or otherwise provided to you (which agreement will, in all cases, govern the parking arrangement). Allocation of parking spaces is not within our control and we do not guarantee the availability of a specific parking spot. Please use your best judgment when deciding on a parking facility or location and do not park at a facility or location that you do not feel is safe and secure. 
We do not represent or warrant the quality, suitability, safety, or security of any parking, and we disclaim all liability arising from any lack of quality, suitability, safety, or security of any parking or otherwise related to your use of parking and parking facilities and locations(including, without limitation, liability regarding the safety or security of persons or property inparking facilities and locations, and the consequences of not being able to park or delays associated with parking). This limitation does not preclude the refunds listed herein or other remedies available to you by law. 
FordPass Rewards (Not available in Puerto Rico and U. S. Virgin Islands) 
When you register with FordPass, you are automatically enrolled in FordPass Rewards. Then, you must activate your account before you can earn Points or Tier Activities (as defined below). FordPass Rewards ("FPR") is brought to you by Ford and participating Ford and Lincoln dealerships ("Dealers"). Participation in FPR is subject to these terms and conditions ofSection 8(collectively, the "FPR Terms"). 
MEMBERSHIP
Membership in FPR is open to U. S. residents, excluding residents of U. S. territories, 18 years of age or older, or the age of majority in their place of legal residence, whichever is older. Membership is only open to individuals; companies, groups and organizations cannot be members. You must have a valid email address at the time of enrollment. Your FordPass account email address may only be associated with one FPR member and one membership account ("FPR Account"). Individuals may not have multiple memberships. However, a household may have more than one membership. Individuals who have the same permanent address are members of the same household ("Household"). Memberships cannot be merged or transferred. You may register an eligible vehicle with your FPR Account. Only vehicles which are owned by a member of your Household may be registered to your FPR Account. 
EARNING POINTS
FPR allows Members to earn FordPass Rewards Points ("Points"). To earn Points or achieve Tier Activities (as defined below), you must have activated your account and have an active valid FPR membership within 60 days after any FPR activity. 
Points can be earned through multiple different activities, ("Qualifying Point Activities"), including the purchase of Ford, Motorcraft, or Omnicraft parts, and any associated labor from a Participating Dealer, as well as through use of FordPass and other Ford-related activities. If a Member uses Points to discount the price of a product or service (including but not limited to Recurring Payments), the Member will only earn Points for the net discounted price paid in cash. Points will not be awarded for paid taxes, fees, or shipping. Clickherefor more information about earning Points. 
Members can also achieve Tier levels through a variety of Qualifying Tier Activities ("Qualifying Tier Activities"). Clickherefor more information about Tier levels and Qualifying Tier Activities. Qualifying Point Activities and Qualifying Tier Activities are collectively referred to as Qualifying Activities ("Qualifying Activities"). 
In some cases, a Member may earn both Points and earn activities toward Tier elevation for the same Qualifying Activities. However, some activities may only earn Points and others may only be designated as a Qualifying Tier Activity. FPR may provide bonus Point earning opportunities and Tier Activities to select members at the sole discretion of Ford. 
Points will typically be deposited into an FPR Account within 10 days of confirmation of completing all of the requirements of a Qualifying Activity, and Qualifying Tier Activities will typically be reflected within 60 days of confirmation of completing all of the requirements of a Qualifying Activity. A qualifying vehicle purchase may take at least sixty days to be deposited or reflected. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain Qualifying Activities may require additional time to validate, therefore you should allow additional time for Points and Qualifying Tier Activities to be deposited into or reflected in your FPR Account. 
Points and Qualifying Tier Activities are not transferrable. 
MEMBERSHIP TIERS
FPR has three Membership Tiers ("Tiers"): Bronze, Silver and Blue. Bronze is the entry level Tier. Silver and Blue Tiers may be achieved in a calendar year ("Qualification Year") by completing Qualifying Tier Activities. 
Tier status begins when Qualifying Tier Activities are reflected to your FPR Account based on your Qualification Year activity. You must earn a minimum number of Qualifying Tier Activities ("Qualifying Threshold") during the Qualification Year to attain or renew Silver or Blue Tier status. 
Silver or Blue Tier status is retained for the remainder of the year in which the Qualifying Activity took place, plus the next full calendar year. 
REDEEMING POINTS
FordPass Rewards Points can be redeemed for various items and services from Ford; for discounts on the purchase of a vehicle, service, parts or accessories atanyparticipating Dealerand online at Accessories. Ford.com or FordParts.com; for eligible subscriptions or Recurring Payments; or for any other rewards as determined by Ford (collectively, "Rewards"). Ford reserves the right to modify, add, or remove Rewards redemption options at any time without notice and without further obligations or FPR members. 
Points will be subtracted from your FPR Account balance immediately upon completion of the redemption transaction unless otherwise indicated when redeemed. Rewards may be subject to additional terms and conditions, such as expiration dates, refunds or restrictions on use. 
Once redeemed, Points cannot be refunded or returned to you, unless otherwise indicated when redeemed. If returns or refunds are permissible, the return or refund will be governed by the relevant return or refund policy. When you use your Points to pay for a Recurring Payment, you may be eligible to receive a refund of the Points you used towards the Recurring Payment, if the terms for the Recurring Payment provide for a refund. When you use your Points to pay for a Recurring Payment that is non-refundable, you will not be eligible for a refund of your Points. 
POINTS VALUE
FordPass Rewards Points do not have any cash value. Points are only a measurement of your activities in FPR and are not considered your property. Points are not redeemable for cash, check, or any other form of credit. All aspects of Points may be modified by Ford at any time, including but not limited to the number of Points required for a Reward, the Qualifying Thresholds, qualification periods, or other aspects of the structure of FPR.

Class or Collective Actions 
For purposes of this section: "Us" or "We" shall mean Ford Motor Company, its Assignees, and their employees, directors, officers, agents, predecessors, successors, subsidiaries, and affiliates. "You" shall include yourself, and your successors and beneficiaries. "Party" shall mean either You or Us. 
AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE: Arbitration is a method of resolving any claim, dispute, or controversy (collectively, a "Claim") in front of one or more neutral individuals instead of filing a lawsuit in court and having a trial in front of a judge or jury. 
Each Party may bring Claims against the otheronlyon an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in a class, collective, representative, public injunctive relief, or private attorney general action. The arbitrator maynotpreside over any consolidated, representative, class, collective or private attorney general action involving You and Ford. The arbitrator may award relief only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by the Claims. The arbitrator cannot, without consent of all parties: combine one claim with another, facilitate notification to others of potential claims, or arbitrate any type of representative or multi-plaintiff proceeding. 
If the bar to Claims or remedies for public injunctive relief or private attorney general actions is held unenforceable, You and Ford agree any such Claims or remedies shall be severed and stayed before a Court with applicable jurisdiction pending final resolution of the arbitration on any remaining Claims or remedies subject to arbitration.

Unless and to the extent local law requires otherwise, these Terms are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Michigan, except in relation to any conflict of law provisions thereof. Unless local law mandates otherwise, all lawsuits arising from or relating to these Terms shall be brought in the Federal or State courts located in Wayne County, Michigan. If a court determines that any term or condition in these Terms is illegal or unenforceable, then such term will be eliminated and the remaining terms and conditions will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.
