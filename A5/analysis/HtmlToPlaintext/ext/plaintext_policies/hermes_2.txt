OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Data Storage Outside The European Economic Union And International Transfers
The Hermès group companies are located worldwide. As a result, Personal Information may be transferred outside the country where you are located. This includes transfers to countries outside the European Union ("EU") and to countries that do not have laws that provide adequate protection for Personal Information according to the European Commission. To ensure lawful transfers of data, the Hermès group has implemented Binding Corporate Rules ("BCRs") designed to allow Hermès group companies to transfer Personal Information from the European Economic Area ("EEA") to other Hermès group companies located outside of the EEA in compliance with the European data protection law. These BCRs have been approved by the European data protection authorities. For more information on Hermès group's BCRs, please visit this link. For countries where BCRs are not fully recognized as adequate mechanism, transfers are made on the basis of appropriate contractual clauses approved by the data protection authorities. To obtain a copy of the relevant adequate safeguards, you can send us your request (see below "How to contact us?"). Please visit website_url_lnk for more details about companies of Hermès group.
