However, orders already submitted to us will not be affected by such changes. All prices are subject to the stated delivery charges, as well as any applicable taxes, duties, fees, or levies.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION ("ARBITRATION AGREEMENT") CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES FINAL BINDING OF DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND LG AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Product sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with LG, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if your claims qualify; and you or LG may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.
Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to LG at LG Electronics, USA, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, Arbitration 111 Sylvan Avenue, Englewood Cliffs, NJ 07632. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or request for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys' fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS's most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at website_url_lnk all other disputes shall be subject to JAMS's most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at website_url_lnk JAMS's rules are also available at website_url_lnk or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS's filing, administrative, hearing and other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, LG will pay them for you. In addition, LG will reimburse all such JAMS's filing, administrative, hearing and other fees for disputes, claims, or requests for relief totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and LG. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.
Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND LG HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and LG are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 6(a) (Application of Arbitration Agreement) above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief. ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out by writing us at the following address: LG, Attention: General Counsel, 111 Sylvan Avenue, Englewood Cliffs, NJ 07632, or send an email to: optout@lge.com, within thirty days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you used to set up your Account (if you have one) or to register as a Guest (if applicable), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
Severability. Except as provided in Section 6(e) (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with LG.
Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if LG makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty days of such change becoming effective by writing us at the following address: LG, Attention: General Counsel, 111 Sylvan Avenue, Englewood Cliffs, NJ 07632.
These Terms of Purchase are governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State or commonwealth where you reside, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws of such state or commonwealth, and are binding upon the parties hereto in the United States and worldwide. By agreeing to these Terms, You explicitly agree that any claims or actions that You may otherwise have against LG under the laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States are hereby waived, and that your sole location and applicable law for any dispute is in the United States according to the terms of this Section. You and LG agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the interpretation or construction of these Terms of Purchase.
LEGAL NOTICE TO NEW JERSEY RESIDENTS: The provisions in this section that limit the period of time within which a claim may be asserted against LG and exclude certain damages do not apply to New Jersey residents.
LEGAL NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS: By using the Store, You waive your rights with respect to California civil code section 1542, which says "a general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, and that, if known by him would have materially affected his settlement with the debtor or released party."
STORE CREDIT
Receiving Store Credit

If LG fails or You fail to perform any term hereof and the other party does not enforce such term, the failure to enforce on any occasion will not constitute a waiver of any term and will not prevent enforcement on any other occasion.
