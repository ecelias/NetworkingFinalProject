How the Service Works, Our Service Partners, Restrictions and Limitations
Our Service Partners 
We work with many different affiliated or third-party companies, individuals, and government entities to provide you with the Service. These parties are collectively referred to in these Terms of Service as our "Service Partners" and may include providers of the wireless networks on which the Service relies ("Wireless Service Providers"), emergency response service providers ("Response Providers"), and content providers ("Content Providers"). In some cases, one or more of the Volkswagen Companies may be a Service Partner. In the event that any of our Service Partners impose additional terms and conditions on the services they provide, by accessing such services you agree to comply with any additional terms and conditions imposed by them, which will be available on the myVW website. Some of our Service Partners may use your personal information for their own purposes. We are not responsible for these Service Partners' practices. For more information on how these Service Partners use your information, please review their privacy statements. 
Software 
We use software in connection with the Service. We (or our Service Partners) own or have rights to all such software, and you do not acquire any rights in such software other than the right to use such software as reasonably necessary for you to use the Service as may be further specified and permitted as a part of your Service Plan and these Terms of Service. We (or our Service Partners) may update or modify the software contained in your Vehicle's systems or the Equipment from time to time but are not under any obligation to update such software. We may do this through in-dealership service or remotely (over-the-air) without notifying you or seeking your consent. But we do not guarantee that your Vehicle's systems or Equipment will receive updates. If installed, these software updates and modifications may affect or erase data that you have previously stored on the Equipment in your Vehicle (such as specific route or destination information). We are not responsible for any lost or erased (or otherwise affected) data, information, or content and you are solely responsible for the data, information, and content that you may have downloaded, uploaded, transmitted, or otherwise stored from, to, on, or through the Equipment or Service. 
Points of Interest 
The Service may use various, connected third-party services and Content Providers to make it easier to search for numerous points of interest ("POI"), e.g., charging stations, fuel prices, parking information, weather, travel information, train information, flight information, restaurant search, hotel search, and other available information through the browsing capabilities of the Vehicle's systems or Equipment. In connection with this search feature, your Vehicle's systems or Equipment may send various data or categories of data to us or our Service Partners. You may also receive an "offer icon" next to certain POIs that you search for indicating that special offers and promotions are available. Please review your Vehicle manual for more information. See also below for more information about our privacy practices. 
Events Beyond Our Control 
Various conditions beyond our control may prevent or delay us from providing Service to you or affect or limit the quality of the Service. Some examples are atmospheric, geographic, or topographic conditions (such as tall buildings, hills, or tunnels), damage to or failure to maintain your Vehicle or the Equipment in good working order, government laws, rules, or regulations, failure, congestion, or outages of utility or wireless networks (including interruption of cellular service or interference from multiple connected mobile devices), war, an act of God, natural disasters, inclement weather, and labor strikes. In the event of any of the foregoing, we may, in our discretion, suspend or terminate the Service (in whole or in part) or terminate your Service Plan, without notice to you and without any additional liability. We are also not responsible for delay or failure in providing Service due to conditions beyond our control and you are not entitled to credit or a refund as a result of any such delay or failure. 
In the event of any regulatory, governmental, or other legally-compelled changes, or discontinuation or change of necessary telecommunications systems and services (e.g., if our Wireless Service Provider terminates or restricts wireless services of the type used by your Vehicle's Equipment), we are not responsible for designing, developing, or making available any replacement Equipment to allow you to continue to receive the Service. However, if we or any third party does make replacement Equipment available, you are solely responsible for replacing, as well as the cost of replacing, any Equipment that is necessitated as a result of such change or discontinuation, except that if such change occurs during your Vehicle's base warranty period, while you will still be responsible for the cost of such replacement, we will be responsible for obtaining and providing you with the necessary replacement materials (if applicable). 
Voice Recognition 
Voice recognition software, which may be able to recognize different voices, accents, speech patterns, and words, may be used in connection with the Service. We do not represent or guarantee that such software will recognize or work with your or others' voices, accents, or speech patterns, or recognize some or all words, some or all of the time. 
Additionally, the voice recognition software may integrate products or services that use artificial intelligence tools, including but not limited to ChatGPT or similar third-party service providers, to supplement the voice recognition and voice command capabilities of the Service ("AI Features"). You acknowledge that your use of such features will also be subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable AI Features, and you assume all risks associated with the use of any AI Features that are incorporated into the Service. You also acknowledge that as a result of the Service's use of AI Features, the output provided via the Service's voice command capability may not be completely accurate, error-free, or up to date. You therefore acknowledge and agree that the use of the AI Features and that any actions taken or reliance on such features, are at your own risk. Additionally, you acknowledge that the AI Features may not dynamically (in "real time") retrieve information and that, consequently, the output provided to you may not account for events, updates, or other facts that have occurred or become available after the AI Features were trained. In addition, you agree to not use the AI Features in a way that compromises the safety of others including but not limited to any unsafe uses while operating your Vehicle, or use that is not in compliance with applicable laws. 
Push and Mobile Device Notifications 
The Service may offer push notification or other mobile communication capabilities. In particular, when you install the myVW mobile application, you agree to receive notifications, including push notifications, from us on your device. We may contact you by push notification to send you additional information about myVW, the Service, your Vehicle, marketing communications, or other services and information. You acknowledge and consent to receiving messages or push notifications from myVW and even when you are not actively using the myVW mobile application. You may choose whether or not to continue receiving push notifications by adjusting your device's settings. 
We advise against using any hand-held device, including viewing of any mobile device push notifications, while driving or otherwise operating your Vehicle or any vehicle.

You may be permitted to upload images through the Services, including the option of customizing your vehicle user profile with use of your own profile photo or image. Only you are permitted to create and edit your profile picture if it contains your name or likeness. 
When you upload content, you grant us an irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use and incorporate into any of our software, Services, or other products, and to copy, modify, adapt, reproduce, create derivative works based upon, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute your content. You are solely responsible for all your user content and for any associated rights clearance. You represent and warrant that: you own all your user content or you have all rights that are necessary to grant us the license rights in your user content under these Terms of Service; and neither your user content, nor your use and provision of your user content to be made available through the Services, nor any use of your user content by us on or through the Services will infringe, misappropriate, or violate a third party's intellectual property rights, rights of publicity or privacy, include offensive, obscene, or hateful content, spoof or misuse the identify of another person, or result in the violation of any other applicable law or regulation. You can remove your user content by deleting it. We have the right to remove, disallow, block, or delete any content which in our sole opinion is defamatory of any person, obscene, discriminatory, offensive, pornographic, hateful, inflammatory, objectionable, or which may expose us or our Service Providers to any harm or liability of any type.

VOLKSWAGEN CARE Program Terms and Conditions 
Coverage.
The Volkswagen Care program consists of a number of different pre-paid scheduled maintenance plans. The details are provided below. The plans that apply to YOUR vehicle are specified on your Volkswagen Care Scheduled Maintenance Plan Contract ("Maintenance Contract") with asterisk (*) next to the applicable plans.
What is not covered? 
Volkswagen of America, Inc., an operating unit of Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., ("VWoA") will not pay for parts or services that are not listed in the USA Warranty & Maintenance booklet provided with your Volkswagen vehicle. Examples of those items not covered include, but are not limited to: mechanical breakdown repairs, hoses, brake pads and linings, and wheel alignment and balancing. In addition, VWoA will not pay for maintenance services that are performed by any party other than a participating authorized Volkswagen Dealership, or for loss of time, inconvenience or other incidental or consequential losses. 
Volkswagen Care 
Purchase 
Volkswagen Care is available for purchase only at participating authorized Volkswagen Dealerships in the U. S. Volkswagen Care may be purchased for all 2014 model year and newer Volkswagen new vehicles (except for Routans), and all 2014 model year and newer Certified Pre-Owned and used Volkswagen vehicles (except for Routans).
A plan may be purchased at a participating authorized Volkswagen Dealership either at the time of the retail sale or lease of the vehicle or at a later time. Regardless of when a plan is purchased, the plan must be purchased at full price. The price for each plan is specified on your Scheduled Maintenance Contract.
When a plan is purchased at the time of the retail sale or lease of a Volkswagen vehicle through an authorized Volkswagen Dealer, it may be possible to finance the cost of the plan as part of your vehicle loan or lease. Please consult with your dealership or financing source for details.
When a plan is purchased at a later date, you will not be able to include the cost of the plan into your monthly payment for your vehicle loan or lease. It is therefore highly recommended that you purchase a plan at the time you purchase or lease your vehicle, or before the first Scheduled Maintenance Interval (as defined below) of the plan.
Dealer sets final customer price for the plan. Tax on the sale of the plan or parts supplied under the plan may be due at the time of sale or at the time of each scheduled maintenance service as required by state and local law where the work is performed.
Scheduled Maintenance Intervals 
Each of the scheduled maintenance plans cover the cost of the factory recommended scheduled maintenance services as specified in the USA Warranty & Maintenance booklet at the defined Scheduled Maintenance Intervals, as follows

The in-service date is the date that your vehicle is delivered to either the original purchaser or the original lessee, or if the vehicle is first placed in service as a "demonstrator" or "company car", then the date such vehicle is first placed in service. An authorized Volkswagen Dealership will be able to provide you with the in-service date of your vehicle.
Note: VWoA highly recommends that the scheduled maintenance be performed within 1,000 miles of the Scheduled Maintenance Interval or one year from the date that the scheduled maintenance was last performed on the vehicle, whichever occurs first. For complete details regarding scheduled maintenance, please consult your vehicle's USA Warranty & Maintenance booklet or contact your Volkswagen dealer or Volkswagen Service Facility for more information, including information about any changes to the service intervals for your Volkswagen vehicle. Services performed outside the maintenance parameters listed above may be excluded from reimbursement.
All Scheduled Maintenance Intervals must be completed by bringing your vehicle to a participating authorized Volkswagen Dealership. Scheduled maintenance performed by a non-participating Volkswagen Dealership will not be covered by your Volkswagen Care plan. You are responsible for confirming that the Volkswagen Dealership at which you intend to obtain scheduled maintenance is a participating authorized Volkswagen Dealership before obtaining scheduled maintenance at that dealership. Except for at a few select participating dealers, at-home service will not be provided, and you will be responsible for transporting your vehicle to a participating authorized Volkswagen Dealership.
Contract Expiration 
Your Maintenance Contract will expire once the last Scheduled Maintenance Interval covered under such contract has been exceeded by three months or 6,000 miles, whichever occurs first. VWoA will not pay for any scheduled maintenance completed after the expiration of the Maintenance Contract.
General Terms (Non-California) 
Volkswagen Care plans are only valid in the country in which they are purchased. This Scheduled Maintenance Plan Contract is effective on the date that you electronically sign the contract ("Effective Date") and expires when all covered Scheduled Maintenance Intervals have been performed or you have failed to obtain maintenance on your vehicle before the expiration of the Scheduled Maintenance Plan Contract, as set forth above in the scheduled maintenance interval section. All Scheduled Maintenance Intervals must be completed by a participating authorized Volkswagen Dealer in order to qualify under this program.
Volkswagen Care plans cannot be canceled and are non-refundable, except as provided below. After 30 days from the Effective Date, no refund will be given if the vehicle is sold, the lease on the vehicle is terminated early or if the lease term expires before the end of the Scheduled Maintenance Intervals or before you obtain maintenance in connection with a Scheduled Maintenance Interval.
There are three circumstances in which the Volkswagen Care plans associated with your vehicle may be canceled with a complete or partial refund given: if the vehicle covered by the plan is designated as "totaled" by the insurance carrier, then you may cancel the plan and receive the specified refund; if the vehicle covered by the plan is repossessed, then the lienholder may cancel the plan and receive the specified refund; or if you submit a written request to cancel the Scheduled Maintenance Plan Contract within 30 days of the Effective Date in accordance with the instructions below, then you may cancel the plan and receive the specified refund. The amount of any refund will be based on whether you have obtained scheduled maintenance under a Scheduled Maintenance Interval or whether the Scheduled Maintenance Interval has expired, as set forth in the chart below. A Cancellation Fee will be deducted from any refund, as provided in the chart below. For purposes of any Scheduled Maintenance Plan Contract cancelled within 30 days of the Effective Date or refunded due to the vehicle being totaled or repossessed, a Scheduled Maintenance Interval will be considered to have "expired" if, at the time of cancellation, the vehicle's odometer reading is above the Scheduled Maintenance Interval mileage.
The chart below shows the refund amount available on vehicles eligible for refund, based on the Scheduled Maintenance Intervals that have been either performed or that have expired. If the purchase of the Maintenance Contract was financed, VWoA may make the refund payable to the purchaser, the assignee, or lender of record, or both. No state or local taxes are included in any plan refund.

These Terms of Service, including any other VWoA terms, policies, and guidelines identified or referenced herein, constitute the complete agreement between you and us with respect to the Services and are legally binding upon the earlier of your agreement to these Terms of Service or your access, use, subscription to, purchase of, upload or transmission to, or download of any information, content, or other materials to or from the Services. When you accept these Terms of Service during our sign-up process by using the myVW mobile application ("myVW App"), or when you are accessing or using the Services, you are acknowledging and agreeing that you have read, understood, and have agreed to be bound by these Terms of Service. You are responsible for your own compliance with these Terms of Service and for compliance by any other drivers or occupants of your Vehicle and anyone who uses your VW Car-Net account, whether or not authorized by you.
In addition, your use of the Services, the VW Car-Net website at website_url_lnk an external link (the "VW Car-Net Website"), and the myVW App are governed by these Terms of Service and the VWoA Privacy Statement that is incorporated into these Terms of Service. A copy of the VW Privacy Statement is available hereOpens an external link, as well as on the VW Car-Net Website and in the myVW App. The parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates of VWGoA, including, but not limited to, Volkswagen AG (together with VWoA, the "VW Company(ies)"), are third-party beneficiaries under these Terms of Service, and the protections set forth in these Terms of Service, including, without limitation, the disclaimers of warranties and limitations of liability, shall extend to them.
We can change these Terms of Service; change, add, or delete Services and Service Plans; and change the prices we charge for each Service Plan, at any time.

Setting Up Your Car-Net Account
In order to use the Services, you must agree to these Terms of Service. The terms of your specific Service Plan, including the applicable pricing if you continue the Service after any introductory period and other terms that are part of your Service Plan, are part of these Terms of Service. You will be bound by these Terms of Service if any of the following events occur: your Vehicle purchase or lease agreement contains a provision that says you agree to these Terms of Service; you sign a contract that includes these Terms of Service; you purchase or lease a Vehicle that includes the Service in the purchase or lease price and you register for the Service; you speak with a VW Car-Net customer service representative and register for the Services; you authorize your independent VW-authorized dealership ("VW Dealer") to register for the Services on your behalf; you or someone you authorize to use your Vehicle and the Services uses the Services or accepts any of its benefits.; or you agree to use the myVW app.
In order to receive all available functionality or features of the Services under a service plan you select ("Service Plan," as further described in Section 4 below), you will be required to create an account through the VW Car-Net Website or the myVW App. You will be asked to provide identification information as part of the registration process and may be required to provide a credit card. Some functionality or features of the Services require your registration for an account with the myVW app. When you create an account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of any username, password, and personal identification number you use to set up and access your account. You will be solely responsible for all activity in your account, so you must notify us immediately if you become aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account or the Services.
The Services permit you, through your myVW App account, to designate a "Primary Driver" (or "Primary User" as referenced by your Vehicle settings) and "Secondary User" of the Vehicle.

As between the Primary Driver/User and any Secondary Users, the Primary Driver/User retains ultimate authority to modify, cancel, change, reactivate, or transfer the Services. As a reminder, these Terms of Service apply to you, including the Primary Driver/User and any Secondary User.
Although the Services will generally be available in all Vehicles, there will be some variability by model or year, and some Services will not be enabled for use until you have installed required Equipment or you register for a trial or paid subscription service, either at your VW Dealer or on your own. 
How the Services Work; Restrictions and Limitations
Equipment and Coverage Area
The Services are provided using hardware and software in your Vehicle ("Equipment") that enables your Vehicle to receive telematics and other services though the wireless communication networks of wireless service providers and the Global Positioning System ("GPS") satellite network. The Equipment receives GPS signals and communicates with our response centers through the use of wireless and landline communications networks. The location of your Vehicle, particularly in rural or enclosed areas, may affect the availability and quality of the Services. Some or all of the Services may not be available in all areas. Services may only be available if your Vehicle is in a geographic area covered by the service network footprint (and within operating range) of one of our wireless providers and is able to receive GPS signals. Services are currently only available in the continental United States (including the District of Columbia), Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Notwithstanding the foregoing Service area restriction, it may be possible for your Vehicle to send and receive data in areas when Services are not available.
Not all Services are available everywhere, particularly in rural or enclosed areas, at all times. You expressly release us and our VW Car-Net Service Providers (defined in Section below) from all liabilities and losses (including, without limitation, physical injury and death) that you or others may suffer in a situation where some or all of the Services are not available.
Please see the Vehicle's available manuals to understand specific connected services and features, such as locating a lost or stolen Vehicle, emergency assistance and service, and content providers.
Our Privacy Practices with Respect to Your Vehicle and Data
For information on our data collection, sharing, and use practices, please refer to the VWoA Privacy Statement available here. 
The Service may use various, connected third-party services and Integrated Content Providers to make it easier to search for numerous points-of-interest ("POIs"), e.g., charging stations, fuel prices, parking information, weather, travel information, train information, flight information, restaurant search, hotel search, and other available information through the browsing capabilities of the Vehicle's systems or Equipment. In connection with this search feature, your Vehicle's systems or Equipment may send various data or categories of data to us or our Service Partners. You may also receive an "offer icon" next to certain POIs that you search for indicating that special offers and promotions are available. Please review your Vehicle manual for more information. See also below for more information about our privacy practices.
Third-Party Service Providers
We work with many different companies, individuals, and government entities to provide you with the Services. These may include, for example, and without limitation, telecommunications providers, wireless providers, call center service providers, public safety operators, emergency personnel, towing companies, equipment and software manufacturers, licensors, and any parties that provide any service, equipment, features, or facilities necessary for the Services to work. These parties are collectively referred to in these Terms of Service as our "VW Car-Net Service Providers." In some cases, a VWoA affiliate or subsidiary may be a VW Car-Net Service Provider.
The Services include offerings from various third parties with whom we contract to provide their products and services through VW vehicles ("Integrated Content Providers") and whose services may be integral to the Services and without which, some of the Services may not work. As a third-party provider, VWoA does not create or control the content or service offering made available by these Integrated Content Providers. The Integrated Content Providers are exclusively responsible for the content and the availability of the service offering accessible through the Services. Integrated Content Providers have the right to use your data for their own purposes; therefore, services from Integrated Content Providers will be subject to their terms and conditions and privacy statements. However, certain Integrated Content Providers' or Optional Third Parties' (defined below) services may require that you maintain certain settings or updates in your Vehicle in order for the accompanying services or features to function property. Links to the additional (and available) terms and conditions of Integrated Content Providers may be found on the VW Car-Net Website or in the myVW App. Your agreement to these Terms of Service and use of the Services to which you subscribe constitutes your agreement to any such Integrated Content Provider terms. VWoA collects and shares information with these Integrated Content Providers and receives information from these Integrated Content Providers for the purposes described above and in order for you to receive the services and content requested. For a complete list of the Car-Net Integrated Content Providers and their respective contact information, please see the list of Integrated Content Providers in the VWoA Privacy Statement.
In addition to the Integrated Content Providers' services available as part of the Car-Net Services, you can obtain or purchase additional services or offerings from other third parties that we introduce or with whom you independently engage that rely on the Car-Net platform ("Optional Third Parties"). Services provided by Optional Third Parties are not integral to the basic operation of Car-Net Services but may be added by you in order to receive additional services and content from the Car-Net platform. Examples of services provided by Optional Third Parties include remote package, fuel, or other in-vehicle delivery; car sharing; tolling pricing; usage-based insurance; or other third-party services. Services or offerings from such Optional Third Parties will be subject to their own separate terms and conditions and privacy statements. Although not comprehensive, for your convenience, links to some of the additional terms and conditions of Optional Third Parties (including, but not limited to, Verizon and T-Mobile for Wi-Fi services), as well as their pricing rates, may be found on the VW Car-Net Website or in the myVW App.
By facilitating your access to any services provided by Integrated Content Providers or Optional Third Parties, VWoA makes no representations about or endorsements of such services. Your relationship in connection with these services is solely between you and the provider. You should carefully review the terms and conditions of each provider you use.

You may not, and you may not permit a third party to, access the Software except as stated in these Terms of Service. Further, you may not modify, translate, decompile, create derivative works of, copy, distribute, disassemble, broadcast, transmit, publish, remove, or alter any proprietary notices or labels, license, sublicense, transfer, sell, mirror, frame, exploit, lease, private label, grant a security interest in, or otherwise use in any manner not expressly permitted herein the Software.

We, or our VW Car-Net Service Providers, may update or modify the software contained in your Vehicle's systems or the Equipment from time to time ("Software Updates") but are not under any obligation to provide a Software Update. Software Updates may be available through in-dealership service, over-the-air (or OTA), or via download and may occur automatically or require you to initiate the required download or installation. We may provide notice of Software Updates to you in a variety of ways, including through your Vehicle's infotainment system, an associated mobile or web application, email, or text messaging, or by other VWoA-approved means of communication. We strongly suggest that you install or permit the installation of the Software Updates as soon as you receive notice of them. You also agree that if you allow a person who is not the Primary Driver/User of the Vehicle to use the Software, you are responsible for ensuring that such person using the Vehicle installs or permits the timely installation of all Software Updates and authorize such person to install or permit the installation of such Software Updates. You understand and agree that if you do not install the updates, the software for the Vehicle may not be updated or improved for your use. If permitted, these Software Updates may affect or erase data that you have previously stored on the Equipment in your Vehicle (such as specific route or destination information). We, and our VW Car-Net Service Providers, are not responsible for any lost or erased (or otherwise affected) data, and you are solely responsible for the data that you may have downloaded, uploaded, transmitted, or otherwise stored from, to, on, or through the Equipment or Services.
Voice Recognition
Voice recognition software, which may be able to recognize different voices, accents, speech patterns, and words, may be used in connection with the Services. We do not represent or guarantee that such software will recognize or work with your or other voices, accents, or speech patterns or recognize some or all words some or all of the time.
Voice control systems that are made available in the Vehicle may be supplemented by third-party content providers outside of VWoA. To use such voice control functions, you must accept the applicable content provider's terms of use. 
Additionally, the Software used with the voice recognition service may integrate products or services that use artificial intelligence tools, including, but not limited to, ChatGPT or similar third-party service providers, to supplement the voice recognition and voice command capabilities of the Service ("AI Features"). You acknowledge that your use of such features will also be subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable AI Features, and you assume all risks associated with the use of any AI Features that are incorporated into the Service. You acknowledge that as a result of the Service's use of AI Features, the output provided via the Service's voice command capability may not be completely accurate, error-free, or up to date. You therefore acknowledge and agree that the use of the AI Features and that any actions taken or reliance on such features are at your own risk. Additionally, you acknowledge that the AI Features may not dynamically (in "real time") retrieve information and that, consequently, the output provided to you may not account for events, updates, or other facts that have occurred or become available after the AI Features were trained. In addition, you agree to not use the AI Features in a way that compromises the safety of others, including, but not limited to, any unsafe uses while operating your Vehicle or use that is not in compliance with applicable laws. 
Events Beyond Our Control
Various conditions beyond our control may prevent or delay us from providing any or all of the Services to you and may affect the quality of the Services.

Additionally, the availability and use of the Software may be subject to your Vehicle's equipment compatibility, software compatibility, telecommunication capabilities, or your Vehicle being within the range of the wireless network of the wireless carrier that supports your Vehicle's telecommunication (with rural or enclosed areas having a negative impact) and is subject to transmission limitation or interruption, including, but not limited to, technical obsolescence or sunsetting of certain equipment, devices, networks, or software inside of or external to the Vehicle that is required for data transmission or receipt. You are not entitled to a credit or refund as a result of any delay or failure described herein.
In the event of any regulatory, governmental, or other legally compelled changes, or discontinuation or change of necessary telecommunications, systems, services, or technologies (for example, if your wireless provider terminates, sunsets, or restricts wireless services or communication technologies of the type used by your Vehicle's Equipment), it may be necessary to replace Equipment for you to continue to receive Services.

Terms Applicable to Specific Services or Service Features
Protecting Login Credentials
It is your sole responsibility to safeguard your authentication information and not share it with any third-party for use in accessing your online account. Neither we nor any Service Partner has any obligation to inquire about the authority of anyone using your Vehicle or other information that can be used to identify your account to request, modify, or use the Service for your Vehicle.
You are responsible for the security of any passwords you use to access the Service. We will make any changes to your account or charge you for any amounts authorized by a person who provides your authentication information.
SHARING YOUR AUTHENTICATION INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES IS NOT PERMITTED BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND MAY LEAD TO A BREACH OF YOUR PRIVACY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, YOUR LOCATION AND DRIVING HISTORY INFORMATION, AND YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. ADDITIONALLY, SHARING YOUR AUTHENTICATION INFORMATION MAY LEAD TO YOUR LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE'S CONNECTED SERVICES. We and our Service Partners reserve the right to limit or discontinue service if we suspect that your authentication information is being used by a third party, even if you intentionally shared your authentication information.
Use of Service Buttons in Overhead Console (Two or Three-Button Module)
Your Vehicle may be equipped with certain service buttons, which may include an i-Button, Wrench Button, and SOS Button. Please consult the owner's manual for information on service buttons including important warnings. 
If you have enrolled in a plan for Services but have not created a Car-Net account through the VW Car-Net Website or the myVW App, available Services may be limited, including Services available through Vehicle service buttons. Please enroll and create a Car-net account through the VW Car-Net website or the myVW App.
Calls with our Volkswagen Response Center representatives, emergency personnel, or law enforcement may be monitored or recorded for purposes of quality assurance, issue resolution, maintaining service, training, or promoting or providing services. Our Volkswagen Response Center representatives and our VW Car-Net Service Providers' customer service representatives may remain on the line while conferencing in a third party to assist in completing a service request. You (for yourself and your Vehicle's occupants and anyone else acting or using the Service on your behalf): expressly consent to the monitoring and recording activities described herein; and release us and our VW Car-Net Service Providers from claims, liabilities, and losses resulting in connection with any such monitored and recorded communications.
Non-Emergency Roadside Assistance
If you have paid for the applicable Service Plan that includes non-emergency roadside assistance (or if this Service Plan is included as complimentary), we will attempt to arrange for roadside assistance services when you request it through the Wrench Button in your Vehicle. Non-emergency roadside assistance (such as help with a flat tire) accessed through the Wrench Button in your Vehicle is provided by third parties that may involve additional cost to receive. For example, you may be required to pay fees to a towing company if your car is towed for repair service. If certain roadside assistance services were included in the purchase of your Vehicle for a limited period of time, such third-party fees may be covered during that time, and you will be required to pay the third-party fees following the expiration of the included roadside assistance period or those third-party fees for services that were not included in the purchase of your Vehicle.
Emergency Assistance
If you have paid for the applicable Service Plan that includes emergency assistance (or if this Service Plan is included as complimentary), we will attempt to contact appropriate emergency personnel, such as police, fire department, or emergency responders, for assistance when you request it through use of a service button or when the Equipment if your Vehicle signals for it. However, we cannot guarantee that any such emergency personnel will respond in a timely manner or at all. We will assume an emergency exists if we receive a crash notification signal from your Vehicle, such as a signal that your air bags have deployed. If applicable laws require an emergency to be confirmed before emergency personnel provide service, we will not contact emergency personnel in these areas until we hear your request for assistance, reasonably believe an emergency exists, or otherwise confirm that an emergency exists.
YOU EXPRESSLY RELEASE US AND OUR SERVICE PARTNERS FROM ALL LIABILITIES AND LOSSES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PHYSICAL INJURY AND DEATH) THAT YOU OR OTHERS MAY SUFFER IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IN THE EVENT OF OUR FAILURE TO CONTACT APPROPRIATE EMERGENCY PERSONNEL, OR A SITUATION WHERE THE SOS BUTTON, ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE BUTTON, OR SERVICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE.
Locating Your Vehicle if it is Stolen
If you have paid for the applicable Service Plan that includes location services for stolen vehicles (or if this Service Plan is included as complimentary), we will attempt to locate your Vehicle if it has been stolen. Our policy is to only provide location information about stolen vehicles directly to law enforcement after receipt of required information and confirmation that the vehicle is stolen, which may take some time. Neither we nor our VW Car-Net Service Providers have any obligation to continue our attempts to locate your Vehicle after 30 days from the time it is first reported stolen to us, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to find it. We do not have any obligation to try to find your Vehicle outside of a Vehicle theft situation, such as trying to locate an individual for you. If your Service Plan provides you with the ability to locate your Vehicle, such as through a mobile application, you should not use this feature to try to locate a stolen vehicle for your own safety. Such efforts are for appropriate law enforcement agencies.
To enable you to continue to receive the benefits of the Services in the event your Vehicle is recovered, we do not terminate the Services when you report that your Vehicle is stolen, and we will not terminate the Services unless and until we get express instructions from you. However, if we have activated a stolen vehicle location service for your Vehicle, some Services may be suspended or unavailable during the time the stolen vehicle location service is activated.
Vehicle Health Reports
Your Service Plan may allow you to receive point-in-time diagnostic information regarding your Vehicle's operations ("Vehicle Health Report"). Not all systems and components are reported by the Vehicle Health Report, but Vehicle Health Reports are automatically shared with your dealer to help manage service and repair unless you opt-out (through the myVW app) of the sharing of such information with your dealership. The Vehicle Health Report does not replace the need to perform scheduled maintenance and vehicle inspections. Refer to your Vehicle's warning and indicator lights for the most current diagnostic information. Always consult owner's literature for maintenance guidelines. You should always follow the Vehicle's scheduled maintenance instructions, regularly inspect your Vehicle, and seek diagnosis and repair of damage or concerns at an authorized Volkswagen dealership. Failure to perform scheduled maintenance and regularly inspect your Vehicle may result in vehicle damage, serious injury, and lack of warranty coverage.
Scheduling Service Appointments
Depending on your Service Plan and your VW dealership's participation in the program, you may be able to schedule an appointment with your VW dealership through the Service. Your request for a service appointment is a request that we send to your VW dealership and is not an agreement by us or your VW dealership to accept all the items contained in your request or to complete them. If you would like to change the VW dealership we have on file for you, you can change it using the VW Car-Net Website or myVW App. We, and your VW dealership, reserve the right at any time to decline or cancel any appointment at any time after you schedule it. We, or your VW dealership, will endeavor to give you notice of such cancellation.
By accepting these terms, you consent to sharing your Vehicle data and other information provided to us in connection with VW Car-Net registration and Services as described in the VW Privacy Statement. Certain information, including your Vehicle Health Report, will be shared with your preferred dealer for your Vehicle unless you opt-out (through the myVW app) of the sharing of such information with your dealership. You may be contacted by us or an authorized VW dealership to discuss certain information available from your Vehicle, such as warning lights, or depending on your Service Plan, your Vehicle Health Report. Some Vehicle issues require immediate attention. You should not solely rely on the outreach described here to schedule service appointments or otherwise attend to your Vehicle; any outreach to you by us, any VW dealerships, or third parties is intended for your convenience only and does not replace your responsibility to perform scheduled maintenance, regularly inspect your Vehicle, heed warnings and instructions in your owner's manual, deliver your Vehicle to an authorized service provider for certain repairs, or comply with recall campaigns. You should always refer to your Vehicle's warning and indicator lights for the most current diagnostic information and always consult your owner's manual for maintenance and repair guidelines.
DriveView Services and Optional Insurance-Related Data Sharing
Enrolling in Car-Net will also enroll you in the DriveView service. DriveView is a service program where we offer driver scores that can show you how you are driving, including a "DriveView Score," by looking at things such as average speed, average speed below 2 mph (idling), hard braking, and night driving. Users enrolled in DriveView Services may also opt-in to share certain GPS, driver behavior, and other data with certain insurance-related companies to be considered for insurance discounts. For more information, please review the separate DriveView and Insurance-Related Data Sharing Terms of Service available hereOpens an external link, which shall apply to your participation in those programs.
Service Limitations Based on Model or Trim Levels
The services and features provided by the Services may not work with or be available to all models or trim levels of Vehicles. If you purchase your Vehicle from a VW dealership, the dealership should be able to inform you about any Services that your Vehicle does not support.
