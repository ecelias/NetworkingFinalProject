Information about us
The following Primark entities are responsible for website_url_lnk When we refer to "Primark", "we", "our" or "us" in these terms of use and elsewhere on our Site, we mean: primark US Corp.

Accessing our Site
Access to our Site is permitted on a discretionary basis, and we reserve the right to withdraw or amend the functionality we provide on our Site without notice (see below). We may also restrict access to some parts of our Site, or our entire Site from time to time. We will not be liable if, for any reason, our Site or any of its functionality is unavailable at any time or for any period.
Our Site is directed to people residing in the United States. We do not represent that content available on or through our Site is appropriate for use or available in other locations.
Sharing your images with us
If you upload images on your Instagram account using the hashtags #Primania and #Primark, your image may be selected for use in the Primania gallery on our Site and you confirm that such image is owned by you. You must also comply with the content standards set out in these terms of use and in our Primania Gallery Terms.
If your image is selected for the Primania gallery, you will receive an Instagram comment from @primark (or in certain circumstances, a direct message), requesting permission from you to use your image in our gallery, in our social media postings, on our Site, in our stores and in our marketing communications. Please be aware that everyone in the image must have provided permission for the image to be posted in the Primania gallery, which includes parental permission where necessary.
We use a service called Social Native to review images for inclusion in the Primania gallery. We will process the personal data in your image in accordance with our Privacy Notice.
You confirm by uploading an image using the #Primania and #Primark hashtags, subject to our Privacy Notice, that you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use the image (and any part of it including any intellectual property rights relating to the image). This includes (but is not restricted to) giving us the right to use, copy, distribute, modify, edit and publish the image (in whole or part). We can, throughout the world, publish the image on other pages of the Site, other websites (such as our social media pages) or in our stores, and we can incorporate the image in other forms of media or technology.

If you would like us to delete an image within our control, you can request that we do so by emailing us at help.primark.com to request that we remove your image. Please send us screenshots of the images that you would like us to remove. If the image is copied (e.g. by other individuals in breach of our terms of use), is used in another form of medium or technology by another party or is shared by you (e.g. on a third party site), it will be out of our control and we are not obliged to and will not be able to delete such image.
We will not be responsible for the content or accuracy of any image posted by you. We have the right to remove any image on our Site for any reason as we see fit including if, in our opinion, such image does not comply with the content standards set out in these terms of use and in our Primania Gallery Terms.

If you wish to report an interactive service you may do so using the 'report this look' button.

If it is deemed by us, at our sole discretion, to not comply with these terms of use, our Privacy Notice, Cookie Policy or Primania Gallery Terms, the image will be removed. Please note that on certain browsers, due to Cache memory, the take down process could take approximately 1 hour to complete. Alternatively you may contact us through the Contact Us page.
