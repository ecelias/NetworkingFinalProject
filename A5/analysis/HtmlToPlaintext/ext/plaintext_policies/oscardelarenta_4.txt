ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, IMPORTANT, PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
Arbitration Notice
You and Oscar de la Renta agree that if there is any dispute or claim arising from or related to our Services (except for the Exempt Claims, as defined below), these Terms & Conditions, and the Privacy Policy it will be resolved by confidential binding arbitration in New York, rather than in court, after first giving Notice of the Dispute ("Notice") to the other party and the opportunity to discuss resolution within thirty days of such Notice. The Notice to the Company should be sent to Oscar de la Renta: 11 West 42nd Street, 25th Fl, New York NY 10036. This Notice must include a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting, and the relief sought. 
If you and Oscar de la Renta are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within thirty days after the Notice is sent, you or the Company may initiate arbitration proceedings to be conducted by a single impartial arbitrator chosen from the American Arbitration Association (AAA)'s National Roster of Commercial Arbitrators by mutual agreement of the Parties (or by the AAA if the Parties cannot agree). There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow the provisions of these Terms & Conditions as a court would. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY FORFEITING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND TO OTHERWISE PROCEED IN A LAWSUIT IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT.
The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply, and the AAA will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.
The arbitration shall be held in the State of New York or at another mutually agreed location. If the arbitration involves a consumer, the arbitration will be held at a location convenient to the consumer. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or we may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and us subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and us unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by applicable law. The arbitrator will also decide any questions relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this arbitration clause, except where a party files a claim in court because it is an Exempt Claim (as defined below). If either party files an Exempt Claim, the court presiding over that claim will determine if the claim is an Exempt Claim under this Arbitration Clause. The arbitrator's award shall be confidential, final, and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms & Conditions to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any change to this Section (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a proceeding against us prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate this Section, any such termination shall not be effective until thirty days after the version of the Terms & Conditions containing this Section is posted to the websites and shall not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a proceeding against us prior to the effective date of termination.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER: YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial.
EXEMPT CLAIMS: You and the Company agree that the following two types of claims are not required to be submitted to an arbitration subject to the following conditions: You or we are not required to arbitrate a claim brought on an individual basis in small-claims court. However, if there is an appeal from small-claims court, or a change in the claim that renders the small-claims court unable to resolve the claim, then the claim must be resolved in an arbitration under the terms of this arbitration provision.
EXEMPT CLAIMS: You and the Company agree that the following two types of claims are not required to be submitted to an arbitration subject to the following conditions: You or we are not required to arbitrate a claim brought on an individual basis to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Such a claim may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights could cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages are an inadequate remedy. The prevailing party in an action to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights is entitled to recover costs and fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in pursuing that remedy.
OPT OUT: You may opt out of this mandatory arbitration provision by writing us within sixty calendar days of your agreement to this arbitration provision, either via email at privacy@odlr.com, or by mail to [mailing address for opt outs]. Include your name, address, [account number,] and date in the correspondence. This is the only way you can opt out.
Claims and Disputes Must be Filed Within One Year
To the extent permitted by law, and without limiting the effect of any disclaimer contained herein, any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to your use of the Services, including, without limitation, any website or mobile application, or other Services-related product, services, or other content must be commenced within one year after the claim or cause of action arises. This section applies to you and your heirs, successors, and assigns.
XI. SEVERABILITY
To the extent that any provision of these Terms & Conditions is deemed to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, including the binding arbitration clause and class action waiver, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms & Conditions. Such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.
XII. TERMINATION
These Terms & Conditions are effective until terminated. We may terminate this agreement at any time without notice to you and may deny you access to our Services.
XIII. INDEMNIFICATION
To the fullest extent permitted by law, and except to the extent arising from our gross negligence or intentional misconduct, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us, and our employees, contractors, licensors, service providers, subcontractors, suppliers, interns and employees, from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of these Terms & Conditions or the documents they incorporate by reference, or your violation of any law or rights of a third party. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you shall cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses. You shall not settle any actions or claims on our behalf without our prior written consent.
XIV. NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES
There are no third-party beneficiaries to the Terms & Conditions. We shall have the right to assign our rights or delegate any of its responsibilities under these Terms & Conditions to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, consolidation, or reorganization for the sale of substantially all our assets.
XV. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS
We reserve the right to change, modify, or amend these Terms & Conditions at any time to reflect changes in our practices and service offerings. If we modify our Terms & Conditions, such changes will be effective upon posting. It is your obligation to check our current Terms & Conditions for any changes. These Terms & Conditions may only be modified in writing. Any ambiguities in the interpretation will not be construed against the drafter.
