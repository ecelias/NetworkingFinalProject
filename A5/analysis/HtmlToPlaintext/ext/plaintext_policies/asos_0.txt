July 2023 marketing preference changes 
You may have received an email or push notification from us recently to let you know that your contact preferences are changing. We've simplified our marketing options from four options (Discounts and Sales, Exclusives, Newness, and Partners) to one option (Discounts and New Drops). This means that if you were opted in to any of our four options, you've been opted in to our new option. If you weren't opted in to any of the four options, you will remain opted out. You can change your preferences any time in 'My Account' when logged in to the ASOS website or app. 
In addition to changing our marketing preferences, we've also made some changes to our app. We'll now identify your push notification preferences according to you as an account holder, rather than by your device. This means that if you were logged in to the app on multiple devices, we've now synced your push notification preferences across your devices. If you were previously opted in to push notifications on one device, you'll now be opted in to push notifications across all of your devices. You can change your preferences at any time in 'My Account' when logged in to the ASOS app. 
If you have any queries or would like more information, please contact our Data Protection team.
