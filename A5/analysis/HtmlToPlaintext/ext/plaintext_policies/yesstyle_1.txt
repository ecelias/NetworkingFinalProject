How We Protect Your Information and How Long We Keep Your Information 
To protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control we have implemented security measures on our website. 
When you place orders or access your account information, a secure server is employed. All information you input is encrypted by the secure server layer before it is sent to us and all the customer data we collect is similarly protected against unauthorised access. 
YesStyle cannot be and is not responsible for unauthorised access to information by hackers or others who have obtained such access through illegal measures. 
"Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it might be from YesStyle asking for your personal information, do not respond. YesStyle would not request your password, user name, credit card information, or other personal information through e-mail. 
We will only store your information as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information is collected and processed or, where applicable law provides for longer storage and retention periods, for the storage and retention period required by law. After that your personal information will be deleted. 
How We Share Your Information 
Except as described in this privacy policy, YesStyle will not share your personal information with third parties unless you have consented to the disclosure or under the following limited circumstances. 
Within Our Corporate Group 
YesStyle may share your personal information with other companies in our corporate group. 
We have a legitimate interest in sharing your information for internal administrative purposes, in particular to offer the products and services on our website and mobile app and to deal with any inquiries in an efficient and high-quality manner. If you or the relevant Data Controller are located in the EEA, you have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to such sharing. To exercise this right you may at any time contact us as provided under "How To Contact Us" below. 
Business Transfers 
If YesStyle is acquired by or merges with another company, YesStyle may transfer personal information to that company (including transfers made as part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings). In such an event, YesStyle will notify you before your personal information is transferred if this information would become subject to a materially different privacy policy. 
Service Providers 
YesStyle may from time to time share the information we collect from and about you with other third-parties that provide support services to us, or that help us market our products and services. Examples are shipping vendors, billing and refund vendors, payment card processors, promoters and administrators of sweepstakes, contests, giveaways and promotions, and companies that help us improve our product and service offerings and our websites. These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not authorised to use the information we share with them for any other purpose. In some cases YesStyle and third-party service providers may share tracking information, including your IP address, and YesStyle may provide information about your order to the website that has referred you to YesStyle (and the referral network utilised by such website), to facilitate calculation of any commissions payable by YesStyle.
