Browsing data and cookies
Browsing data
During their normal operation, the computer systems and software procedures used to operate the Website acquire some personal data, the transmission of which is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.
This information is not collected to be associated with identified persons, but by its very nature could allow users to be identified through processing and association with data held by third parties.
These data are used for the sole purpose of obtaining anonymous statistical information on the use of the Website and to monitor its correct operation, and are deleted immediately after processing.
The data could be used to ascertain responsibility in the event of hypothetical computer crimes to the detriment of the Website. With the exception of this eventuality, the data are stored for the time established by the relevant legal regulations, or in general for the time strictly necessary to provide the user with the service requested to guarantee the transmission of the communication.
Cookies and other tracking tools
Cookies are usually strings of text that websites (so-called publishers or "first parties") visited by the user or other websites or web servers (so-called "third parties") directly or indirectly place and store on the user's terminal device.
The information encoded in the cookies may include personal data such as an IP address, a username, a unique identifier or an email address, but may also contain non-personal data such as language settings or information about the type of device a person is using to browse the website.
Cookies can therefore perform important and varied functions including monitoring sessions, storing information on specific configurations regarding the users accessing the server, facilitating the use of online content etc.
Types of cookies
Cookies can have different characteristics in terms of their duration (session or permanent) or subjectivity (depending on whether the publisher is acting on its own or on behalf of a "third party"). However, the classification that mainly meets the needs of protecting the user is one based on two macro categories, technical cookies, used for the sole purpose of "transmitting a communication over an electronic communications network, or to the extent strictly necessary for the provider of an information service explicitly requested by the contractor or user to provide such service" (see art. 122, paragraph 1 of the Privacy Code). These cookies can be installed on the user's terminal without consent, either based on the need to respond to a request or on the legitimate interest of the Moncler Local Company.
profiling cookies, used to link specific actions or recurring behavioral patterns in the use of the functions offered to specific, identified or identifiable parties in order to group the various profiles within uniform clusters of various sizes, so that among other things the controller can modulate the provision of the service in an increasingly personalized manner beyond what is strictly necessary for the provision of the service, as well as send targeted advertising messages, i.e. in line with the preferences expressed by the user while browsing the web. This type of cookie can be downloaded to the user's terminal only with the user's consent.
Among other things, cookies may also be used to assess the effectiveness of an information society service provided by a publisher, to design a website or to help measure its "traffic," i.e. the number of visitors, including by geographic area, connection time or other characteristics. These identifiers, defined as analytics cookies, can be included in the category of technical cookies, and as such may be used without the prior consent of the data subject, provided that the following conditions are met: they are only used to produce aggregate statistics and in relation to a single website or mobile application.
Among other things, cookies may also be used to assess the effectiveness of an information society service provided by a publisher, to design a website or to help measure its "traffic," i.e. the number of visitors, including by geographic area, connection time or other characteristics. These identifiers, defined as analytics cookies, can be included in the category of technical cookies, and as such may be used without the prior consent of the data subject, provided that the following conditions are met: at least the fourth component of the IP address is masked for third-party cookies.
Among other things, cookies may also be used to assess the effectiveness of an information society service provided by a publisher, to design a website or to help measure its "traffic," i.e. the number of visitors, including by geographic area, connection time or other characteristics. These identifiers, defined as analytics cookies, can be included in the category of technical cookies, and as such may be used without the prior consent of the data subject, provided that the following conditions are met: third parties refrain from combining these analytics cookies with other data (e.g. customer files or statistics of visits to other websites) or from transmitting them to third parties.
If these conditions are not met, analytics cookies require the user's consent in order to be downloaded. 
Finally, cookies may also be used to enable interaction and easy sharing of content on social networks and to enable the sending of targeted advertisements based on user preferences (social cookies). These cookies also require the user's consent.
