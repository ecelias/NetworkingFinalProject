Prices, taxes, fees
We aim to provide our customers with competitive prices on the products we offer. Prior to submitting your order you will have the opportunity to review product prices and any applicable sales tax, shipping, and handling charges. Prices are exclusive of, and Customer shall pay, all taxes, duties, levies or fees, or other similar charges imposed on HP or on the Customer by any taxing authority (other than taxes imposed on HP's income) related to Customer's order.
If you feel your order should be tax exempt you must provide a valid tax exempt certificate-other than a resale certificate-at the time you place the order. HP.com sales are intended for personal use and not for resale so we do not accept resale certificates. Please review the detailed instructions regarding submittal of valid acceptable certificates. 
For orders shipped to California, effective January 1, 2005, we are required to collect a recycling fee on qualifying products.
Notify HP.com promptly should you believe your order has a pricing error.
Prices, specifications, availability and terms of offers may change without notice. Price protection, price matching or price guarantees do not apply to Intra-day, Daily Deals or limited-time promotions. Should we lower the price of the product you purchased within the return and exchange period, please review our Price protection information for full details, exclusions and steps to make a qualifying price drop request. Quantity limits may apply to orders, including orders for discounted and promotional items. 
Despite our best efforts, a small number of items may contain pricing, typography, or photography errors. Correct prices and promotions are validated at the time your order is placed. If an item's correct price is higher than our listed price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.
These terms apply only to products sold by HP.com; reseller offers may vary. Items sold by HP.com are not for immediate resale. Orders that do not comply with HP.com terms, conditions, and limitations may be cancelled. Contract and volume customers not eligible.
Personal Use
Products, services, gift cards, and support acquired by Customer under these Terms are solely for Customer's personal use and not for immediate resale or sub-licensing.
HP gift cards are not for resale
For your protection, only purchase HP gift cards directly from HP. We do not guarantee or replace gift cards purchased from other stores or directly from individuals.
Payment and financing
We accept HP Financing, credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express), PayPal, Google Pay, and HP.com gift cards. Payment options for our business customers include Purchase Order, ACH, wire transfer, and leasing. Our qualified leasing customers will have the option to defer payments for 90 days. Want to know more? Please call 1 (888) 999-4747 for additional information.
Order acceptance and cancellation
Your payment account will be charged when you place your order. Once placed, your order cannot be changed.
If a change is necessary after order placement, we have a limited amount of time (one hour) to cancel and resubmit the order. Your order will begin processing within one hour of being placed. If your order has reached processing status, the order may not be cancellable.
For security reasons, we do not allow address changes after an order has been placed.
If you need to cancel your order within that hour, please chat or call our Customer Service team at 1 (800) 407-4005, Monday through Friday, 8 am to 8 pm EST. 
For custom-built PC's the factory receives your order as soon as it is approved. Since the PC is custom built, your order can not be changed or modified once the order has been submitted.
Please note HP.com reserves the right to decline or cancel orders at any time. In such instances, we provide notification via email to the email address you provided when submitting your order. We assume no responsibility for issues resulting from such declines, cancellations, or email notification failure.
Product Availability and Limitations
Given supply constraints of some of our products, HP may limit the number of products available for purchase. HP reserves the right to change quantities available for purchase at any time, even after you place an order. Additionally, there may be occasions when HP confirms your order but subsequently learns that we cannot supply the ordered product. In the event we cannot supply a product you ordered, HP will cancel the order and refund your purchase price in full.
Shipping
HP.com ships to street addresses within the 50 United States and the District of Columbia. We cannot deliver to P. O. boxes, private mail box stores, freight forwarders, United States territories, or addresses outside the 50 United States and the District of Columbia. Customer accepts liability if customer chooses to ship to a restricted location. Click here for complete information on shipping and delivery.
For your protection, a signature is required for most deliveries. We do not allow address changes after an order has been accepted. You may not export any products purchased at HP.com.
Since the actual delivery of your order can be impacted by many events beyond HP's control once it leaves our facilities, HP is not liable for late deliveries. We will, however, work with you to ensure a smooth delivery and communicate delays in shipment as we become aware of delays.
As HP takes care of the fulfillment and shipping of the products you purchase on the HP Store, the risk of loss of, or damage to, products shall pass to you when you, or a person designated by you, acquires physical possession of the products. Title in the products shall pass to you when the products is picked up by the carrier from our warehouse. At this point, you will receive the Shipment Notification Email. If there are any issues with delivery, please contact HP Store Customer Service to resolve. All claims must be made within 10 days of delivery or of the last scan of the package tracking. After that period, HP's ability to locate or resolve any claims is limited. Claims received after this point may be denied by HP.
If the shipping box appears damaged from the outside at the moment the shipment is delivered, you have the right to refuse the shipment. Please have the deliverer/driver note the nature and extent of the damage on the shipping receipt. The carrier will return the shipment to HP. Contact HP Store Customer Service (over the phone, chat or through email) immediately to inform us.
If you sign for delivery receipt, but later determine that the product is cosmetically damaged (scrapes, dents, etc.) or operationally damaged (the system will not work) in shipping, take digital photographs of the damaged product and the inside and outside of the box it was received in. Contact HP Store Customer Service immediately and provide documentation of the damage in detail. All claims must be made within 10 days of delivery. Claims received after this point may be denied by HP.
Returns
Our return policy provides details on what products may be returnable and additional details. Upon return request approval, we will provide a prepaid return label for return to our warehouse. The customer is responsible for safe, complete and intact return to HP. Please note HP.com reserves the right to decline or cancel return requests at any time. In such instances, we provide notification via email to the email address you provided when submitting your order. Our labels are for use within the United States; returns from outside the U. S. must be first returned to the U. S. at the customer's expense.
