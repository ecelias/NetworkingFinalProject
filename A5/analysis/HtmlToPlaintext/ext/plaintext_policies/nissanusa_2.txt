Use of Personal Data
Nissan uses Personal Data (except for Sensitive Personal Data) in various ways, such as to tailor services to you. We often use data to improve the services you receive.

Disclosure of Information
Nissan may disclose Personal Data to Third Parties for the following purposes: operational or legal reasons, to facilitate operational functions (such as recall or service campaign mailings) or audit or legal functions, to comply with a valid legal, regulatory, or court process (for example a valid subpoena, court order or warrant or discovery request), to provide to any successor to any aspect of our business (if Nissan sells any portion of its business, the new owner may access Personal Data through that transaction) or to Third Parties in the event of a merger, transfer of ownership or assets, bankruptcy or other corporate reorganization.
Providing services or marketing, to our Affiliates or Nissan dealers for operational or business purposes such as providing services to you or for joint marketing initiatives, to Service Providers, such as SiriusXM, to provide NissanConnect Services, or to Third Parties contracted to do business on our behalf (for example, website hosts, Service Providers, email platform providers, advertisers or those running promotions on Nissan's behalf).
Categories of Information We Collect, Use and Disclose (Including Use or Disclosure for Targeted Advertising)
The following chart identifies broad categories of Personal Data as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act and provides information on the specific types of Personal Data within those broad categories that Nissan collects for all U. S. Consumers (as allowed by law) based on your interactions with Nissan and the consents you have provided where needed. The chart also identifies how Nissan uses the data, how Nissan collected the data (from where or from whom did we receive it), and when and to whom Nissan disclosed the Personal Data for a business purpose in the last 12 months. 
Some state laws define the "sale" of Personal Data as any instance of disclosing that data to a Third Party for any benefit, even if no money is exchanged. Where a disclosure is considered a "sale" under state privacy laws in California or elsewhere, we have highlighted these instances by describing the disclosure in Bold Underline.
In addition to the information provided in the chart, please note in the course of business we may unintentionally receive some Personal Data not described below (for example, if you contact our customer support function and include in your email some Personal Data we do not request). Though we try to eliminate any unrequested, unneeded information, there may be cases in which this Personal Data remains in our systems for some period of time.
In addition to the information provided in the chart, please note in the Data Nissan Collects/Uses column below, we identify certain types of data we collect and use in order to illustrate which types of data points fall within the broad category we actively collect and use. This column does not include every possible example and there may be similar data points that the chart does not explicitly disclose, but we have provided representative examples that explain the most common uses of each type of data described. For example, this column discloses that we may collect and use postal address, which is intended as a general statement that may encompass similar data points, such as current postal address, former postal address, and secondary mailing address.
In addition to the information provided in the chart, please note like all companies, Nissan has a legal obligation to share some Personal Data with government entities in certain situations. For example, we are required to share Personal Data such as name and social security number to the IRS when we pay someone (such as a sweepstakes or contest winner). We are also obligated to provide certain limited Personal Data according to the terms of a subpoena, court order, search warrant or if requested by a legal organization in case of a lawsuit. We only supply such information with appropriate documentation, and we provide the minimum amount required to protect our legal status or to meet our compliance or legal requirements.
In addition to the information provided in the chart, please note nissan shares some information with our affiliated Nissan companies in order to facilitate business we do together and accomplish our shared business goals. For example, we may share your name and contact information, along with the VIN of a vehicle you have purchased, with our affiliated NMAC organization to facilitate an auto loan you have requested.
In addition to the information provided in the chart, please note nissan uses Service Providers to help us with our IT systems, data management, security, and software applications that may hold or interact with Personal Data. We use these Service Providers to help ensure that the data is protected in accordance with high industry standards. We share the Personal Data in most of the broad categories described in the Data Nissan Collects/Uses column with these Service Providers and obtain assurances from those vendors that limit the ways in which they are allowed to use your data.
In addition to the information provided in the chart, please note although Nissan uses "sale" below as required by state privacy laws in California and elsewhere, we think you should know that Nissan does not create or sell any customer inference profiles. Nissan does not sell any driving activity data to insurance companies for programs that might directly impact your premiums unless you have consented or asked an insurance company to retrieve this information, nor do we sell personal data to marketing companies to send you advertising for products or services that are not related to Nissan.
In addition to the information provided in the chart, please note to the extent your phone number is obtained for the specific purpose of an SMS messaging campaign governed by an Application-to-person (A2P) 10 digit long code (10 DLC) registration submitted to the Campaign Registry, your phone number will be used solely pursuant to the terms you consent to when you enroll in that specific offer and not shared with any Third Parties.
