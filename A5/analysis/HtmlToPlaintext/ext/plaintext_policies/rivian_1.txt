Rivian maintains separate data privacy notices for different types of data processing. For example, this Notice does not apply to personal Data of our Workforce. Any processing of your personal data as a Rivian employee, temporary worker, contingent worker, or independent contractor is governed by the Workforce Data Privacy Notice that we maintain and make available to these workforce members. 
Rivian maintains separate data privacy notices for different types of data processing. For example, this Notice does not apply to non-Personal Data. Any processing of data that cannot be linked to an identifiable or identified individual (i.e., non-personal-data) is not governed by this Notice. Rivian reserves the right to process this data for any legitimate business purpose. 
Rivian also maintains other data privacy notices that are specific to a particular Rivian affiliate, product, or service. These other notices govern our processing of personal data for those affiliates, products, or services, unless the notice is marked as supplemental to this Notice, and can be located on our website or are presented to you when you use a particular product or service. 
This Notice does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any website or service to which our products or services link. The inclusion of a link within our products or services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates.
In addition, we are not responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure, or security policies or practices of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including with respect to any personal data you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Rivian Mobile App or our social media pages.
Rivian may provide functionality allowing you to make payments to us using third-party payment services. When you use such a service to make a payment to us, your full payment card information will be collected by such third party and not by us, and your payment information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, this third party's collection, use, and disclosure of your personal data.
PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT
We collect and use personal data for a number of purposes, including to provide and continuously improve our products and services, such as increasing the range and reliability of Rivian vehicles and identifying opportunities to make your journey even safer. The information we collect, and how that information is used, depends on how you interact with us, the products or services you use, and the choices you make. This data also depends on the type of relationship we have with you. If you disclose any personal data relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with our products and services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Notice.
We may collect personal data about you from different sources and in various ways, including directly from you. Through your relationship with us, such as when you provide data to us directly on the Site, via email, or through your online or offline/in-person interactions with us. Unless we request it, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal data (e.g., information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, or criminal background) to us. 
We may collect personal data about you from different sources and in various ways, including indirectly from you. From your use of our vehicles or other products, services, mobile applications, or software. 
We may collect personal data about you from different sources and in various ways, including from third-party sources. From our service providers, public agencies (e.g., the DMV), relevant parties (e.g., your bank or insurance company), and public sources, including public forums and social media or networking sites. We may also collect or acquire personal data about you from third-party data providers, including demographic, lifestyle, financial, and other activity and interest data that we use to tailor our communications and promotional materials to you. 
When we use data to improve and develop features, products, and services, we take steps to minimize the data collected and to apply privacy-enhancing techniques, such as de-identification or pseudonymization, so the data is not directly associated with you or your vehicle. Where we conduct such activities on an identifiable basis, we do so with your consent, consistent with reasonable consumer expectations, or where there are compelling and legitimate interests for such processing (e.g., improving vehicle or public safety). This approach to product improvement and development applies across all of our products and services.
We do not "sell" personal data or personal information, as this term is defined by applicable privacy regulations. We do "share" personal information as defined by Cal. Civ. Code §1798.140(ah) with third-party advertisers, as explained in Section 10 ("U. S. State Privacy Disclosures") below.
We describe the personal data we collect, how we use it, and the privacy choices available to you for each of our major products or services below.

Your Privacy Choices
You have choices regarding the collection and use of certain data associated with your vehicle, such as those described below. These privacy choices will apply to all drivers of your vehicle. Because of this, we rely on you to inform anyone else driving your Rivian vehicle of this Notice and the privacy choices you have made. If you are (or work for or on behalf of) a commercial customer, your choices may be governed by the contract executed between Rivian and that company or organization, as permitted by applicable law.
Interior Camera. Vehicles built for model year 2025 and onward are equipped with an interior camera in the rearview mirror. If you choose to enable data sharing from the interior camera, images of the vehicle cabin and data derived from these images will be shared with Rivian to improve and develop vehicle safety systems, including machine-learning models and the driver monitoring system, which can help detect driver distraction and drowsiness. You may exercise this choice using the toggle in the vehicle's "Data and Privacy" page. Toggling off this data sharing will not affect driver assistance functionality. To protect your privacy, we:
Do not associate these images with you or your vehicle for product improvement or development. 
Collect images only while your vehicle is in Drive (not while in Park).
Analyze or use interior camera data on a de-identified or pseudonymized basis, except: where you have requested our review (e.g., for service or support) or provided your consent; or to comply with a legal obligation, such as regulatory reporting or litigation. 
Some vehicles built before model year 2025 have an interior camera that was disabled with an OTA software update. Interior cameras in these vehicles remain inactive and the option for interior camera data sharing will not appear in the "Data and Privacy" screen of the vehicle's Settings menu.
If you choose to install your own cameras or similar driver monitoring devices, we are not responsible for this data collection or processing. 
Exterior Cameras. The vehicle's exterior cameras can capture images, as described below. 
Gear Guard. You may choose to capture images through the exterior cameras located on the vehicle while driving, during an incident or other triggering events, such as the use of the horn or hazard lights, or while the vehicle is parked or stationary. You control the collection and use of these images, which may be stored in the vehicle's internal memory or on an external storage device that you provide, and we do not access or process these images without your consent.
Product Improvement. Drivers of vehicles built for model year 2025 and onward may choose whether images are shared with Rivian to improve driver assistance safety features like Highway Assist and Automatic Emergency Braking. (Images are not captured for this purpose from vehicles built before model year 2025.) If you toggle off the privacy control for sharing these images, the exterior cameras will process images solely in the vehicle to provide these driver assistance safety features. You may exercise this choice using the toggle in the vehicle's "Data and Privacy" page. Toggling off this data sharing will not affect driver assistance functionality. To protect your privacy, we:
Do not associate these images with you or your vehicle for product improvement or development.
Blur faces and license plates before being viewed. (Unblurred images may be used in computer simulations or similar analyses but will not be viewed by an individual.)
Do not use the first and last three minutes of your drive to protect privacy at your home, work, and other starting or ending locations.
Associate precise location with the images if you have agreed to location data sharing for driver assistance. This allows us to understand and diagnose driver assistance issues that can occur at a particular location, based on road segment features such as lane markings or signage. 
Exterior images will be shared with Rivian automatically in the event of a crash and associated with your VIN regardless of your choices above to enable crash investigation and regulatory reporting. 
Precise Location. You may choose to stop sharing your precise location data with Rivian and our service providers for navigation, Highway Assist, the Rivian Mobile App, Alexa, and data analytics purposes. If you turn off this sharing, certain functionality may be limited or disabled. Note: Your precise location will still be shared with us for critical safety purposes, such as eCall/SOS and for incidents. Your general location, about a 7-mile radius, will still be shared with us regardless of your in-vehicle precise location settings. Additional information may be found in the "Data and Privacy" screen of the vehicle's Settings menu. 
Third-Party Vehicle Apps. You may choose whether to use third-party applications in the vehicle (e.g., Spotify, Alexa) and thus whether these apps collect personal data from you. We recommend you review the terms and conditions, privacy policies, and settings for any third-party app or service to which you subscribe to and use in your Rivian vehicle. A third party may ask you to grant certain permissions, for example, information about the vehicle's location. If you choose to use these third-party apps, we are not responsible for the data you share, which is subject to the third party's privacy policies. 
Vehicle Connectivity. Vehicle connectivity is a core feature of Rivian vehicles and allows us to deliver many of the amazing features in the vehicle, such as navigation using real-time data, key safety features such as lane keeping assistance, and remote diagnostics. Vehicle connectivity also allows us to continually improve your driving experience through remote service and support and over-the-air updates, which provide new features, better performance, safety enhancements, and bug fixes. You may, however, choose to disable all cellular connectivity of the vehicle. For Canadian vehicles, you may exercise this choice using the toggle in the vehicle's "Data and Privacy" page. For non-Canadian vehicles, you may reach out to Rivian Service to request that we disable the eSIM card in the vehicle through a service appointment. Note that disabling all vehicle connectivity will limit vehicle features and advantages. 
Insurance Services. If you choose to use Rivian insurance services, we collect and use personal data gathered in connection with your application for, and use of, these services. Your personal data is not shared with our insurance partners unless you have consented to such sharing. Rivian's Insurance team may occasionally review a limited set of driving data for customer-owned vehicles to determine if they might qualify for an insurance discount based on this data. You may opt out of this internal analysis and insurance remarketing through our Privacy Rights Request form (select "Other" request type). Only if the driver is interested in understanding the potential discount, and explicitly consents to Rivian sharing their data, do we share this limited driving information with our insurance provider. We do not share data with telematic exchange companies. You may access our GLBA-required privacy notice for insurance on our website. 
Financing Services. If you choose to use Rivian financing services, we collect and use personal data gathered in connection with your application for, and use of, these services. Your personal data is not shared with our financial partners unless you have consented to such sharing. You may also access our GLBA-required privacy notice for financing on our website. 
Vehicle Resale. If you sell your Rivian vehicle, you are responsible for deleting any information saved on the vehicle (e.g., recent destinations in the vehicle's Navigation system, Gear Guard videos) prior to making the vehicle available to the new owner and notifying us of the sale. You may do so using the "Clear Settings" feature in the vehicle. If you do not delete this information, it may be visible to the new owner. You may also remove the vehicle from your account using the Rivian Mobile App. Please see additional information here. If you buy a Rivian vehicle from a party other than Rivian, you should ensure that the seller removes the vehicle from their account using the Rivian Mobile App and notifies Rivian of the sale so that the seller's vehicle access is removed. You are also responsible for submitting the required paperwork to Rivian so that we may verify the authenticity of the transaction and complete the ownership transfer process. Please see additional guidance on private party transactions here.

Your request must provide sufficient information about you (which may include personal data such as your name and other personal identifiers) and your relationship, if any, with us that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. We will only use personal information provided in the request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make it. 
Financial Incentives. We may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information's value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
