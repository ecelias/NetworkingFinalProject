IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF HONG KONG: CUSTOMS ISSUES, REGIONAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND PRODUCT REGULATION 
YesStyle's product inventory available on the Site includes tens of thousands of products, and product listings are constantly being changed and updated. YesStyle's customers are located in various parts of the world. As a result, it is not practical for YesStyle to confirm whether import and sale of any of these products may conflict with local exclusive distribution rights in effect from time to time or otherwise constitute a violation of local law, including product safety and other regulations. 
YESSTYLE MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT THE PRODUCTS IT SELLS ARE GENUINE AND LEGITIMATE. IMPORT AND SALE OF CERTAIN OF THE PRODUCTS OFFERED ON THE SITE, HOWEVER, MAY NOT BE PERMISSIBLE IN ALL COUNTRIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AS A RESULT OF LOCAL CUSTOMS REGULATIONS, LOCAL COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK RIGHTS AND OTHER LOCAL LAWS. IN ADDITION, PRODUCTS AVAILABLE ON THE SITE MAY NOT CONFORM TO PRODUCT SAFETY OR OTHER REGULATIONS IN ALL COUNTRIES. 
BY PURCHASING A PRODUCT THROUGH THE SITE, YOU AGREE THAT SUCH PURCHASE AND THE IMPORT OF SUCH PRODUCT COMPLIES WITH THE LAWS OF THE COUNTRY TO WHICH YOU HAVE REQUESTED YESSTYLE TO SHIP THE PRODUCT, AND AGREE THAT YOU WILL BE CONSIDERED THE SOLE"IMPORTER" AND "INITIAL DISTRIBUTOR" OF THE PRODUCT TO SUCH COUNTRY FOR ALL PURPOSES, INCLUDING CUSTOMS REGULATIONS, COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK LAWS AND PRODUCT SAFETY LAWS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YESSTYLE'S ROLE IS LIMITED TO PROCURING PRODUCTS AVAILABLE IN ASIA AND OTHER REGIONS AND MAKING THESE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SITE TO YOU FOR PURCHASE IN HONG KONG AND FOR YOUR IMPORT TO THE COUNTRY TO WHICH YOU HAVE REQUESTED YESSTYLE TO SHIP PRODUCTS. IN NO EVENT WILL YESSTYLE OR ANY OTHER YESSTYLE PARTY BE A PARTY TO THE IMPORT OF SUCH PRODUCTS NOR WILL ANY YESSTYLE PARTY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LIABILITY ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY COUNTRY OTHER THAN HONG KONG FOR ANY REASON, INCLUDING THE IMPORT AND SALE OF PRODUCTS AVAILABLE ON THE SITE, CUSTOMS REGULATIONS AND CUSTOMS HOLDS, DETENTIONS AND SEIZURES, COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK LAWS AND PRODUCT LICENSING AND PRODUCT SAFETY LAWS. 
By purchasing a product through the Site, customers outside of Hong Kong authorize YesStyle to make arrangements for clearance of customs on their behalf for the products they have ordered. 
We make no representation that information on the Site is appropriate or available for use outside Hong Kong. Those who choose to access the Site from outside Hong Kong, do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

Products shown on the Site may contain descriptions that are provided directly by the publisher, manufacturer or distributor of such products. The information on the Site is believed to be complete and reliable; however, the information may contain typographical errors, pricing errors, and other errors or inaccuracies. YesStyle does not represent or warrant that the descriptions of any products shown on the Site (including personal care products) are accurate or complete or up to date. We reserve the right to: revoke any stated offer; correct any errors, inaccuracies or omission; and make changes to prices, content, promotion offers, product descriptions or specifications, or other information without obligation to issue any notice of such changes (including after an order has been submitted, acknowledged, shipped or received). IF YOU PURCHASE A PRODUCT FROM YESSTYLE THAT IS NOT AS DESCRIBED ON THE SITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY SHALL BE TO RETURN SUCH PRODUCT IN UNUSED CONDITION FOR YESSTYLE CREDIT IN THE AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE WHERE RETURN POLICIES APPLY. IF YOU PURCHASE A PRODUCT FROM YESSTYLE THAT IS NOT AS DESCRIBED ON THE SITE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY SHALL BE TO RETURN SUCH PRODUCT IN UNUSED CONDITION FOR YESSTYLE CREDIT IN THE AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE. 
YesStyle has made every effort to display the colors of products on the Site as accurately as possible. However, as the actual colors you see will be affected by, among other things, the color tone displayed on your monitor, YesStyle cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of any color will exactly match the actual colors of the products. 
Prices 
YesStyle cannot confirm the price of a product until you order. It is possible that the price for a product may increase or decrease between the time that the product is placed in a "shopping cart" or "shopping bag" and the time the purchase is actually made. Also, despite YesStyle's best efforts, a small number of the products on the Site may inadvertently display incorrect prices. If the price for the product on the Site is incorrect and is actually higher than the price provided at the time of purchase, then, at the sole discretion of YesStyle, YesStyle may either contact you for instructions before shipping the product or charging you for such product or cancel the order for such product and notify you of such cancellation. 
YesStyle will have the right to cancel any orders for products that have been listed at an incorrect price, rebate or refund, that contain other incorrect information or typographical errors or that are unavailable for any reason. YesStyle will have this right regardless of whether the order has been confirmed or your credit card or other payment service has been charged. If your credit card or payment service has already been charged for the purchase and your order is cancelled, YesStyle will immediately issue a credit to your credit card or payment service in the amount of the charge. 
Price Comparisons and "Save" Amounts 
Price comparisons may be made throughout the Site to indicate the relative savings amounts of YesStyle's pricing. Amounts shown as "Save" reflect the difference between the sale price and YesStyle's normal or "list" price for a given product. However, YesStyle makes no representation that a substantial number of these products have been sold or made available for sale at the list price. 
ORDER PROCESSING, SHIPMENT, RETURNS, WARRANTIES 
Order Acceptance 
The offer and acceptance of orders will be subject to the terms of the third paragraph of these Terms of Use. YesStyle may confirm its receipt of your acceptance by sending a confirmation to the e-mail address that you provide. 
Passage of Title 
Title to products and risk of loss of products, passes to you upon delivery to the common carrier selected by YesStyle to deliver your order. 
You are obligated to take delivery of any products you order notwithstanding that the quantity delivered may be less than the quantity ordered, provided that any amount charged to you shall be adjusted to reflect such lower quantity. Any such discrepancy in quantity shall not be deemed a material change of the terms of sale nor a breach or repudiation of YesStyle's agreement to sell products to you. 
Returns 
YesStyle accepts returns of most defective products, products damaged in shipping and (in the case of clothing) products of incorrect sizes, in accordance with the terms and conditions posted from time to time at "Customer Service, Shipping and Returns."
