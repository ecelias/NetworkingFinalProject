Introduction
This cookie policy covers by Polestar Performance AB's ("Polestar", "we", "us") processing of personal data collected via cookies or similar technologies when you visit our web site; see the contact details below.
Our website uses cookies and similar technologies to improve your browsing experience, personalize content and ads, provide social media features, and analyze our traffic.
This policy is updated continuously to reflect the measures that Polestar takes in relation to your personal data.
Cookies and Pixels
Cookies may store information about you, your preferences, or your device, but they do not usually directly identify you. We use strictly necessary cookies for the website to function properly. For an optimal experience and personalized content, we use functional, performance, targeting and advertising cookies with your consent. You can choose not to allow some types of cookies, but it may affect your site experience.
Cookies are small text files stored on your device that help us enhance your user experience and learn what interests you. We have a cookie privacy manager that allows you to decide how cookies are used. We use a cookie to remember your choices, so you will need to update them if you delete all your cookies or use a different device or browser.
We also use Pixel tags, which are small graphic files loaded from the servers of the respective service provider when a user accesses our website.
First-party cookies
First-party cookies are cookies that we, or contracted service providers, place on the website and with which you interact if you continue to use our website.
Third-party cookies
Third-party cookies are created by domains other than the website you're interacting with, allowing other companies to collect information about your online activities across multiple websites.
Local storage
Local storage is a file created by a website on your device. Local storage has the same function as a cooky. In contrast to cookies, local storage does not have an expiration date, and the data will persist until manually cleared by the user or the website. Local storage data can be deleted through your browser settings. Information stored in local storage can only be accessed by scripts on the same domain.
Cookie Consent Management Platform

We process your geolocation data in the form of your IP address to ensure that we can provide you with the services closest to your current location. This functionality is used throughout our website.
You have the right to withdraw your consent to cookies at any time which you do in the Cookie Consent Management Platform
Should you wish to contact us about this data or other personal data that we process in relation to you, please fill in our webform.

Sharing of your personal data
How we share your personal data and who we share it with
To provide our services and to comply with laws and regulations, we need to share your personal data with others, including other companies within the Polestar Group and third parties assisting us in various parts of our business and helping us to deliver our services. In the tables above you will find information about the third-party cookies we use, and you can also find the categories of recipients listed below.
IT providers: g., companies that manage the necessary operation, technical support and maintenance of our IT solutions,
Polestar affiliates,
Subcontractors: chat services, banks and payment service providers, providers of analytics services,
Authorities, e.g. the police, regulatory authorities, public courts, enforcement agencies,
Business partners, e.g, law firms, advertising companies, and
Providers of social media platforms.
Processing of your personal data outside the EU/EEA
We strive to process your personal data within the EU/EEA area. However, your personal data collected via cookies or similar technologies on Polestar's websites will be transferred outside the EU/EEA in some situations, such as when we share your information with a business partner or subcontractor operating outside the EU/EEA.
We transfer personal data to the following countries outside of the EU/EEA: the United States and the United Kingdom. Our business partners have servers in different countries, and depending on the number of website users and other factors, the services that use cookies may come from any of these countries.
We always ensure that the same high level of protection applies to your personal data according to the GDPR, even when the data is transferred outside of the EU/EEA. As regards the United Kingdom, the Commission has decided that it ensures an adequate level of protection (article 45 of the GDPR). Regarding transfers to the United States or other third countries, we have entered into EU Model Clauses with relevant third parties (article 46 of the GDPR), or they are certified under the EU-U. S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U. S Data Privacy Framework and the Swiss-U. S. Data Privacy Framework with the U. S. Department of Commerce. In addition, we take additional technical and organizational security measures when needed, such as encryption and pseudonymization.
Google
We use Googles Analytics to create a better customer service, to effectively use our resources and to build empathy for our customers' needs. When using Google Analytics, we use a server-side setup for improved privacy control.
The configuration of Google Analytics at Polestar governance: All possible online tracking services added to any part of polestar.com are added through Google Tag Manager ("GTM" is loaded on the website and does not carry out any tracking of its own; it just exists to centralize management of any tracking from any vendor). There are retention limits for user-level data (i.e. non-aggregate) set up in Google Analytics so that user-level data older than 14 months is deleted.
The configuration of Google Analytics at Polestar obeying users' choice in tracking: All tags in GTM go through a test/QA procedure that make sure they abide by the user's cookie consent settings and that the Google Analytics cookies are only activated after the user has accepted the cookies in the cookie banner.
The configuration of Google Analytics at Polestar anonymization: We are anonymizing customer data before it gets to Google's servers. This is done in a number of ways. First, the configuration of Google Analytics on the Polestar website is set up to not send any user IDs or personal data (in tracking packets or accidentally in URLs), and to not retain or process meta data such as IP addresses. Second, Polestar sends the Google Analytics data from a user's browser to a proxy server first (a server-side GTM system under Polestar's control) before it reaches Google Analytics. This allows us to remove information before it is sent to Google Analytics. Included in this is the semi-anonymization of IP addresses: we remove the second half of an IP address to allow us to analyze geographic data on a country scale, but severely reduce Google's ability to fingerprint individual users for other purposes.
The processing locations for Google Analytics are the United Kingdom, based on an adequacy decision, and USA, based on certification under the EU-U. S. Data Privacy Framework, the Swiss-U. S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK Extension to the EU-U. S Data Privacy Framework with the U. S. Department of Commerce.
Meta
A Facebook Ads Pixel is a piece of code provided by Meta that allows us to track and measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns on Meta platforms. It helps us understand how users interact with our website after seeing our ads on Facebook, enabling us to optimize our marketing efforts and deliver more relevant content to our audience. Additionally, the data collected through the Facebook Ads Pixel is used for targeting purposes, allowing us to tailor our advertising based on users' behavior and preferences.
The types of personal data that the Facebook Ads Pixel collects includes device Information (device type, operating system, and unique device identifiers), IP address and cookie data (unique cookie ID).
When a Facebook user has previously clicked on one of our ad campaigns and later returns to our website and fills in any of our forms, personal data is collected to give precise data on the number of users who have been exposed to certain ad campaigns on Facebook and who have converted as a result. The data collected when filling out forms may include name, e-mail address, phone number, geographic data such as town/city, county/region, postal code, and country, and date of birth and external ID.
The processing locations for Facebook Ads Pixels are within the European Union and in the USA based on certification under the EU-U. S. Data Privacy Framework and the Swiss-U. S. Data Privacy Framework with the U. S. Department of Commerce.
