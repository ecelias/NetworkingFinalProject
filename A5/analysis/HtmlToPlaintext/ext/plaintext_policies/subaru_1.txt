ARBITRATION PROVISION 
Definitions 
This Arbitration Provision shall be interpreted broadly. As used in this Arbitration Provision, these terms are defined as follows "Dispute" means any claim or controversy arising from or relating to Your relationship with Subaru, for example any: theories of liability, whether based in contract, tort, statute, or otherwise; claims that arose before this Agreement; claims that arise after the cancelation or expiration of this Agreement; and claims that are the subject of purported class action litigation. "Dispute" does not, however, include any issues relating to the existence, scope, validity, or enforceability of this Arbitration Provision.
This Arbitration Provision shall be interpreted broadly. As used in this Arbitration Provision, these terms are defined as follows ii. "You" means You and any intended or unintended beneficiaries of Your rights under this Agreement.
This Arbitration Provision shall be interpreted broadly. As used in this Arbitration Provision, these terms are defined as follows iii. "Subaru" means Subaru and any of its predecessors, successors, assigns, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, service providers, and independent contractors, and each of their officers, directors, employees, and agents.
Arbitration or Small Claims Court 
All Disputes shall be resolved individually in either: binding arbitration; or small claims court if the claim is for money damages and the amount claimed is within the jurisdiction of that court. In arbitration, there is a neutral arbitrator rather than a judge. In arbitration and small claims court, there is no jury and there is less discovery and less appellate review than in court. 
Procedures for Arbitration 
This Arbitration Provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Arbitrations shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") as modified by the version of this Arbitration Provision that is in effect when Notice of a Dispute is given. The AAA Rules can be obtained from the AAA by visiting its website (website_url_lnk or calling its toll-free number (1-800-778-7879). If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rest of this Agreement, this Arbitration Provision will govern. If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the AAA Rules, this Arbitration Provision will govern. If the AAA will not administer an arbitration in accordance with this Arbitration Provision, You and Subaru will agree on (or, if necessary, petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint) an arbitration organization that will do so. 
ii. The party commencing an arbitration should follow the instructions on the AAA website, including sending the AAA a "Demand for Arbitration" (available on its website), paying a filing fee, and mailing a copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the opposing party. If You commence the arbitration, You must send a copy to Subaru of America, Inc., One Subaru Drive, Camden, NJ 08103, ATTN: LEGAL, ARBITRATION OF DISPUTE. If Subaru commences the arbitration, Subaru must send a copy to Your residential address. 
iii. If multiple arbitrations involving similar claims against Subaru are pending, You and Subaru shall jointly petition the AAA to coordinate those matters to promote efficiency. That coordination may include, for example, having similar matters assigned to the same arbitrator (either for all purposes or for the purpose of deciding an issue that turns on the same factual or legal questions) or having pre-hearing discovery apply to multiple matters. Nothing in this paragraph, however, provides any right or authority for a Dispute to be resolved as part of a class action, collective action, or other representative action. (See Section G, below.) 
iv. Unless You and Subaru agree otherwise, an arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator and any hearing will take place in the county where You reside. 
The arbitrator will issue a written decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions. The arbitrator's award may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction only as necessary to enforce the award. 
vi. Neither the fact nor the substance of any settlement demand, offer, or negotiation may be revealed to the arbitrator before a final award has been issued. 
Right to Arbitral Fees and Costs 
The payment of the AAA's fees and costs will be governed by the AAA Rules except as follows If Subaru commences an arbitration, Subaru will pay all of the AAA's fees and costs.
The payment of the AAA's fees and costs will be governed by the AAA Rules except as follows ii. If You commence an arbitration and state under penalty of perjury that You cannot afford to pay the AAA filing fee, Subaru will pay the filing fee if the AAA does not waive that fee. If Subaru determines that Your representation regarding Your ability to pay was false, however, it may seek to recover that fee from You.
The payment of the AAA's fees and costs will be governed by the AAA Rules except as follows iii. If You commence an arbitration and the aggregate value of Your claim is less than $10,000, You will only be responsible for paying the lesser of the AAA filing fee or the filing fee that You would have paid in the small claims court in the county where you reside, and Subaru will pay the rest of the AAA's fees and costs. If Subaru has received more than twenty-five Notices of Dispute or Demands for Arbitration asserting similar claims, however, the payment of the AAA's fees and costs will be governed by the AAA Rules.
The payment of the AAA's fees and costs will be governed by the AAA Rules except as follows iv. No matter who commences an arbitration, if the arbitrator finds that a claim was frivolous or asserted for an improper purpose, the party asserting the claim will reimburse the other party for any fees and costs that the party asserting the claim would have been obligated to pay under the AAA Rules.
The payment of the AAA's fees and costs will be governed by the AAA Rules except as follows No matter who commences an arbitration, You may pay up to half of the AAA's fees and costs if You wish to do so.
Right to Attorneys' Fees and Costs in Arbitration 
You may hire attorneys to represent You in arbitration. You are responsible for their fees and costs. You may recover them from Subaru to the same extent as in court. If the arbitrator finds that a claim was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, the other party may recover its attorneys' fees and costs to the same extent as in court. 
Effect of Rejecting Settlement Offers 
If the outcome of a legal action is less favorable to the party seeking relief than a settlement offer that party rejected, that party must pay all of the fees and costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the other party after the offer was made. 
Waiver of Class and Representative Actions 
WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, YOU AND SUBARU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PROSECUTE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, OR OTHERWISE SEEK REDRESS FOR ALLEGED INJURIES TO THIRD PARTIES. This waiver is a material and essential part of this Arbitration Provision and cannot be severed from it. 
ii. WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, YOU AND SUBARU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO SEEK PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. This waiver is not a material or essential part of this Arbitration Provision and can be severed from it by a court of competent jurisdiction. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, such a court refuses to enforce this waiver with respect to a particular claim or request for relief, You and Subaru will jointly petition the court to decide that claim or request for relief only after all other claims and requests for relief have been decided. 
Right to Reject This Arbitration Provision 
You may opt out of this Arbitration Provision by sending Subaru written notice by certified mail, postmarked no later than thirty days after the Effective Date, to Subaru of America, Inc., One Subaru Drive, Camden, NJ 08103, Attention: Legal Department. Notices not mailed to that address and postmarked by that date will not be effective. Your decision will not adversely affect Your relationship with or service from Subaru. 
Right to Reject Changes to this Arbitration Provision 
You may reject changes to this Arbitration Provision by sending Subaru written notice by certified mail, postmarked no later than thirty days after Your first receipt of notice of a change, to Subaru of America, Inc., One Subaru Drive, Camden, NJ 08103, Attention: Legal Department. Notices not mailed to that address and postmarked by that date will not be effective. Your decision will not adversely affect Your relationship with or service from Subaru. 
Survival 
This Arbitration Provision shall survive the cancellation or expiration of the Agreement.
