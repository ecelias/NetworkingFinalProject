THIS WEBSITE AND ALL CONTENT AVAILABLE ON THIS WEBSITE ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THOSE ARISING OUT OF A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE, BY YOUR USE OF THIS WEBSITE THAT YOUR USE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE COMPANY AND ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, AND LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY, "AFFILIATES") SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THIS WEBSITE. 
IN PARTICULAR AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE WEBSITE OR THE CONTENT OF ANY WEBSITES OR ONLINE SERVICES LINKED TO OR INTEGRATED WITH THE WEBSITE.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you.

Indemnification and Hold Harmless 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Company, its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms of Use or your use of the Website, including, but not limited to, your User Contributions, any use of the Website's content, services, and products other than as expressly authorized in these Terms of Use, or your use of any information obtained from the Website.
Governing Law and Jurisdiction 
All matters relating to the Website and these Terms of Use, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Tennessee without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Tennessee or any other jurisdiction).
Arbitration 
MOST CUSTOMER CONCERNS CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY AND TO THE CUSTOMER'S SATISFACTION BY CONTACTING CUSTOMER SERVICE AT 800-647-7261. IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT IS UNABLE TO RESOLVE YOUR CONCERNS, WE EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT, INSTEAD OF IN COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AND SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. IN ARBITRATION, BOTH YOU AND THE COMPANY WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS´ FEES FROM THE OTHER PARTY TO THE SAME EXTENT AS YOU WOULD BE IN COURT.
If we are unable to resolve the dispute, and neither party chooses small claims court to resolve the dispute, you and the Company agree to arbitrate any and all disputes and claims between you and us arising out of or relating to this Agreement, use of the Website, products, or services, whether you are a visitor to the Website or a customer, except any disputes or claims which under governing law are not subject to arbitration, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and to make all disputes and claims between us subject to arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, any dispute you or we may have relating to copyrights or other intellectual property shall not be governed by this agreement to arbitrate. For the avoidance of doubt, this means that any claims you or we may have relating to intellectual property rights against the other, including injunctive and other relief sought, may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and the Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class or representative action to the maximum extent permitted by law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce. The Federal Arbitration Act and its procedural rules, not any state laws or procedures regarding arbitration, govern the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. 
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to the Company should be addressed to: Box 685003, Franklin, TN 37068-5003 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and set forth the specific relief you seek from the Company ("Demand"). Neither party shall initiate legal action until 60 days after the Notice is received. In arbitration, and to the extent otherwise permitted by law, the parties may exchange "offers of compromise" or stipulate to judgments or awards in the same way the parties could in court. Such offers of compromise shall have the same force and effect as they would in a court proceeding. The arbitration proceedings shall otherwise remain confidential, except for purposes of seeking court intervention (if necessary).
The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at website_url_lnk by calling the AAA at (800) 778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision as well as the Agreement´s other terms and conditions, and the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any such dispute relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision or any other term of this Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this arbitration provision or Agreement is void or voidable.
The place of arbitration shall be Tennessee. The arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the State of Tennessee. Case Management Conferences and other hearings shall be heard via telephone unless otherwise agreed to. Parties must attend all telephonic and in-person hearings and Case Management Conferences with counsel unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.
Discovery and the exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute will be governed by the AAA Rules.
If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and the above paragraph shall not apply. If an arbitrator finds that your Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, you agree to reimburse the Company for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. If this specific subparagraph is found to be unenforceable in its entirety, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. 
Any claims or causes of action seeking relief not subject to individual arbitration under applicable law shall be stayed in a court of competent jurisdiction pending completion of individual arbitration to the maximum extent permitted by law. 
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if the Company makes any material change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) after your use of the Website, you may reject any such change and require the Company to adhere to the language in this arbitration provision as written at the time of your use of the Website or the purchase at issue if a dispute between us arises, by providing Notice to the Company at the Notice Address listed above. 
Limitation on Time to File Claims 
IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY CAUSE OF ACTION, CLAIM, OR PROCEEDING BY YOU RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE WEBSITE BE COMMENCED OR INSTITUTED MORE THAN ONE YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE.
Waiver and Severability 
No waiver by the Company of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. 
If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.
Entire Agreement 
The Terms of Use, and our Privacy Notice constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and Nissan North America, Inc. regarding the Website and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the Website.
