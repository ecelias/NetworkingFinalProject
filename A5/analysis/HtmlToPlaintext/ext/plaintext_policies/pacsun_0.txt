Explanation of How You Can Exercise Your Rights and What to Expect in the Process
If you are a US resident, PACSUN has decided to allow all its customers and other persons in the United States to make the same privacy requests, which we call Personal Information Requests, regardless of where you reside and regardless whether your place of residence affords you the legal right to make such requests. PACSUN reserves the right to discontinue this policy at any time, and at its sole discretion, and to limit Personal Information requests to only those residents of those jurisdictions with privacy laws affording the applicable rights. The easiest way to submit a request to know is by submitting a Personal Information Request. You may also call us at 1 (877) 372-2786.
Except with respect to Requests to Opt-Out of the Sale or Sharing of Personal Information, PACSUN will verify the person's identity before complying with any such requests. For your request, we will verify your identity by asking you to log in to your account if you have one with us. Or if you do not, we may ask for your email address, order numbers of previous orders, or other information we think would allow us to verify your request. For all requests, PACSUN will verify a person's identity by matching the person's name, email address, and telephone number with its existing records. To verify certain requests related to your Personal Information, PACSUN may require a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that the requestor of the information is the person to whom the personal information requested belongs. Therefore, after receiving a request for or in relation to personal information, PACSUN will contact the requesting person to obtain the signed declaration. If PACSUN cannot verify a person's identity from the information already in its existing records, PACSUN may request additional information from the person which will only be used for the purposes of verifying the identity of the person seeking to exercise the privacy options outlined here and for security or fraud prevention purposes. PACSUN will inform the person if it is unable to verify the person's identity.
Upon verifying your identity, we will proceed with honoring your Personal Information Request promptly, subject to any legal restriction on PACSUN honoring it.
You may elect to have an Authorized Agent submit a Personal Information Request on your behalf. We will honor your representative's request in the same manner and only after we verify your identity to ensure the request is yours. To use an authorized agent, you must provide the agent with signed authorization. In addition, you may be required to verify your own identity with PACSUN and or directly confirm with PACSUN that you authorized the agent to submit the Personal Information Request on their behalf. PACSUN may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on their behalf. Such requirements, however, will not apply where a person has provided the authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to the law of their state of residence.
To use an authorized agent, you must provide the agent with signed permission to submit the request. An authorized agent should submit requests to legal@pacificsunwear.com and should include proof of signed permission from the underlying data subject to submit the request. An authorized agent may also call our toll free number, (877) 372-2786 to submit a request. We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit signed permission demonstrating that it has been authorized by the data subject to submit the request.

Value of Consumer Data
PACSUN Rewards Program: $0.24 per record
The expenses related to the collection of the above consumer data consist of labor costs, software costs, and vendor costs. We follow a method that systemically calculates the value of data: identify types of data, segment data sets, assess date quality, determine data demand, analyze business impact, quantify the contributions of consumer data in terms of revenue generation, cost savings or efficiency improvements. We explore different monetization opportunities for consumer data, including third parties, partnerships or enhancements to products and services. Estimate the potential revenue impact, factor in costs and risks and apply valuation models to estimate the value of consumer data.
PACSUN believes that the financial incentives it offers are reasonably related to such consumer data values because PACSUN has learned from previous experience that the expenses are required to collect that consumer data as part of the incentive programs, and the incentive programs help drive consumer sales and revenue.
