Toyota Respects Privacy
At Toyota, we are committed to transparency and choice when it comes to the collection and processing of personal information.
This commitment has guided Toyota to play a key role in the development and adoption of the Automotive Consumer Privacy Protection Principles. When the California Consumer Privacy Act took effect in 2020, we provided the privacy rights it affords to all U. S. consumers, not just those residing in California. 
Toyota's Privacy Hub is another product of this commitment. With the Privacy Hub, you can quickly and easily learn more about our privacy practices, as well as exercise your privacy rights with us. 
Consistent with Toyota's "Respect for People" and "Customer First" philosophies, the foundation of privacy at Toyota is about doing the right thing for our consumers, team members, and society.
