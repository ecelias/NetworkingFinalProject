While Bose does not disclose our customer's personal information to third parties in exchange for money, Bose's use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that is subject to these state opt out rights.
