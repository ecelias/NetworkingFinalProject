General
Waiver: Any failure or delay by Showpo in exercising a power or right (either wholly or partially) in relation to these Terms does not operate as a waiver or prevent Showpo from exercising that power or right or any other power or right. We are not liable to any other party for any loss, cost or expense that may have been caused or contributed to by the failure, delay, waiver or exercise of a power or right. This clause survives termination of these Terms. 
Force majeure: If we are unable to perform in whole or in part, any obligation under these Terms as a result of any fact, circumstance or matter beyond our control, we are relieved of that obligation to the extent and for the period that it we are unable to perform the obligation. You agree that Showpo will not be held liable for any delay or failure in performance of any part of the Services or delivery of Goods. 
Severability: If any part of these Terms is determined to be by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, that part shall be severed from the Terms.

Relationship: These terms do not confer an agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchisor-franchisee relationship between Showpo and you or any other party unless expressly stated otherwise. 
Entire agreement: These Terms (and all other terms and conditions and policies that are incorporated by these Terms) and any additional policies or terms you have agreed to through use or access of our Services make up the entire agreement, and supersede all prior written and oral agreements, representations, undertakings and understandings.

You irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts operating in Victoria and its appellate courts. Although the Services may be accessed throughout Australia and overseas, we make no representations or warranties that its content, or the Goods, comply with the laws (including intellectual property laws) of any country outside Australia.
