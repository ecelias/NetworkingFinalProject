With respect to any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or related to your access or use of the Site, any products sold or distributed through the Site, all rights and obligations and all actions contemplated by these Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of New York, as if the Terms and Conditions were a contract wholly entered into and wholly performed within New York. ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR ACCESS OR USE OF THE SITE, ANY PRODUCTS SOLD OR DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE SITE, THESE SITE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES (OTHER THAN CLAIMS RELATING TO THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF TOM FORD BEAUTY OR OUR PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PARTNERS OR LICENSORS OR CLAIMS IN EQUITY) SHALL BE FINALLY RESOLVED BY CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION BY VIDEO CONFERENCE OR, AT THE ARBITRATOR'S DISCRETION, BY IN PERSON HEARING IN THE COUNTY WHERE YOU RESIDE (UNLESS THE BATCH ARBITRATION PROCESS APPLIES) AND YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT YOURSELF TO THE JURISDICTION AND PROCEEDINGS THEREOF. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR WILL DECIDE THE CLAIM, AND YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CLAIM. YOUR RIGHTS TO PREHEARING EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND APPEALS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. It is further agreed that any dispute over the scope of this arbitration provision and any dispute as to whether a claim is arbitral shall be submitted to the arbitrator for decision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of our affiliates, partners or licensors or otherwise have a cause of action in equity, TOM FORD BEAUTY may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any court of competent jurisdiction and you consent to jurisdiction and venue in any such court for such purposes. 
Arbitration under this agreement shall be conducted by a sole arbitrator under the American Arbitration Association's Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Rules in effect when the arbitration is commenced, except as they may be modified herein. 
A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a demand for arbitration (the "Demand"). The Demand must include: the name, telephone number, mailing address, e-mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable), as well as the email address associated with any applicable account; a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good-faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; and evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration. 
If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Demand shall also include counsel's name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the Demand. By signing the Demand, counsel certifies to the best of counsel's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: the Demand is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery. 
Subject to the Batch Arbitration process described below, you agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the dispute between us and you individually, and no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; the parties waive and there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported collective, representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons, or mass action basis; and only individual relief is available. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, MASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. 
To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and TOM FORD BEAUTY agree that in the event that there are one hundred (100) or more individual Demands of a substantially similar nature filed against TOM FORD BEAUTY by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a sixty day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award ("Batch Arbitration"). 
All parties agree that Demands are of a "substantially similar nature" if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process ("Procedural Arbitrator"). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Procedural Arbitrator, the parties agree the Procedural Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Procedural Arbitrator's fees shall be paid by TOM FORD BEAUTY if the party seeking the appointment of the Procedural Arbitrator is TOM FORD BEAUTY.
