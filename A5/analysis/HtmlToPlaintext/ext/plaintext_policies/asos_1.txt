Terms & Conditions
The legal bits... 
You are entering into this agreement with aSOS.com Limited ("we", "us"); and
You are entering into this agreement with aSOS Payments UK Limited ("ASOS Payments").
We and ASOS Payments are both companies registered in England and Wales, with registered addresses and HQs at Greater London House, Hampstead Road, London NW1 7FB. Our company number is 3584121 and ASOS Payments' is 13337408.
When you place an order on website_url_lnk or our apps, the seller is ASOS.com Limited, UNLESS the product is identified as being sold by an ASOS brand partners (each an "ASOS Brand Partner"). Where this is the case, the product will be stated to be "Sold and shipped" by an ASOS Brand Partner, or
When you place an order on website_url_lnk or our apps, the seller is ASOS.com Limited, UNLESS the product is identified as being sold by an ASOS brand partners (each an "ASOS Brand Partner"). Where this is the case, the product will be stated to be "Sold by [ASOS Brand Partner] and shipped by ASOS".
When the seller is ASOS.com Limited, your sales contract is with ASOS.com Limited. When the seller is an ASOS Brand Partner, you enter into a contract to buy products with the respective ASOS Brand Partner and a contract with ASOS Payments to pay for those products in the way described below. 
When you shop with us (or access our services, apps and websites (our "Websites")), whether you're buying ASOS products or ASOS Brand Partner products, these terms apply. They're important for both of us and ASOS Payments as they set out what each of us expects from each other, and they also give you helpful info. You can also find out more on our Help pages (which also form part of these terms). Of course, if you need anything else from us or ASOS Payments, get in touch with Customer Care, we always love to hear from you!
We and ASOS Payments keep these terms and Help pages updated and we and ASOS Payments amend them every so often, so remember to check back in before you shop, as the latest set will apply.
About You 
To shop with us or receive services from ASOS Payments, you need to be at least 16 years old.
To shop with us or receive services from ASOS Payments, you need to have a credit or debit card that we and ASOS Payments accept (see bottom of page for details of current payment providers); and
To shop with us or receive services from ASOS Payments, you need to be authorised to use that credit or debit card (e.g. it is in your name or you have permission to use it).
Just FYI, some of the goods sold through our Websites may not be suitable for under 18s. 
You can only place an order for an ASOS Brand Partner product if you are a consumer. We are unable to sell ASOS Brand Partner products to businesses (and will therefore also be unable to supply VAT invoices in relation to any ASOS Brand Partner orders).
Placing an order 
Where you are buying a product directly from us, you will use your card to pay us directly for the product.
Where you are buying a product from an ASOS Brand Partner, you will be paying ASOS Payments to load a credit of an equal amount to an account with ASOS Payments, and then spending that credit to pay the ASOS Brand Partner. In order to do this, you need to access ASOS Payments service by logging in via your ASOS account in the usual way, selecting the product you wish to buy from the ASOS Brand Partner, and then pressing the "Place Order" button. By pressing that button, you will be both authorising ASOS Payments to take a payment from your card to pay ASOS Payments for a credit to your ASOS Payments account; and instructing ASOS Payments that you wish to spend the credit to pay the ASOS Brand Partner. You can only instruct ASOS Payments to use credits to pay ASOS Brand Partners.
When you place an order, you should receive an acknowledgement e-mail confirming receipt of your order. We or (if you're buying from an ASOS Brand Partner) ASOS Payments then carry out a standard pre-authorisation check to make sure there's enough money on your card to pay for or towards the order.
We only accept your order once payment has been approved and we or ASOS Payments have debited the payment card (and then the contract is made based on these terms).
You may be able to cancel (not change) your order within a short period of ordering, timings depend on your chosen delivery method and whether you purchased from an ASOS Brand Partner (and will be set out in the acknowledgement email). You can't change your order, you'll need to cancel (and/or return original items), and re-order.
All orders are subject to availability and confirmation of the order price. Don't worry, if there's an issue with an order, we'll get in touch with you.
All products remain ASOS property or the property of the relevant ASOS Brand Partner until full payment of the purchase price is received by either us or ASOS Payments, as the case may be.
Very occasionally, we or ASOS Payments may need to refuse or cancel an order or close, block or freeze an account (even if we have previously confirmed your order), e.g. if we notice something unusual on an order or an account or if your order goes against unit limits as detailed on the product display pages of specific products. If your account has been blocked and you think we've made a mistake, please get in touch with Customer Care and they'll be happy to speak to you about it. 
You can end this agreement with ASOS Payments at any time by ceasing to use the ASOS Payments service to purchase Brand Partner products, but if you do you won't be able to pay for ASOS Brand Partner products. You can't cancel any payments that you've already made through ASOS Payments.
Products sold by ASOS Brand Partners are excluded from affiliate cashback reward schemes. You therefore won't receive cashback on any order made with an ASOS Brand Partner.
Using Klarna or Clearpay? 
Using Klarna or Pay Later in 3 with Klarna? Klarna's Pay in 3 / Pay in 30 days are unregulated credit agreements. Borrowing more than you can afford or paying late may negatively impact your financial status and ability to obtain credit. 18+, UK residents only. Subject to status. For Terms and Conditions, click here. Late fees apply.
Using Clearpay Pay in 4? Some different terms apply, see here for more details on Clearpay.
Delayed Payment Services
The delayed payment services we offer, such as Klarna or Clearpay, are not always available to select. We may determine not to offer delayed payment services based on conditions of use, such as shopping history or suspected misuse. To continue with your order, you will need to select one of our other payment types at checkout.
Prices and product descriptions 
There's a lot going on here at ASOS HQ and from time to time our busy ASOSers may price up or describe a product or promo wrongly. If we discover an error for any goods you've ordered, we will tell you ASAP and give you the option of reconfirming your order (at the correct price) or cancelling it. 
If we can't get in touch with you, we will treat the order as cancelled. If you cancel and you've already paid, we will refund you in full. 
Prices include VAT (where applicable), but keep in mind that there may be other taxes that you need to pay which aren't imposed by us or ASOS Payments. 
Depending on the value of your order or the delivery option or address you choose, delivery costs may also be charged (see below). Such additional charges will be clearly shown during the checkout process and included in the 'Total Cost'.
For some products you may notice that the price you see for one size sold by us is different to another size if it is sold by an ASOS Brand Partner. This is because ASOS Brand Partners determine the selling price of their products and we can't legally align on prices.
Personalisation
We may personalise your user experience on our Apps and Website (including for example, by recommending, prioritising or deprioritising the display of certain products or categories of products) by taking into account your browsing and shopping history including your rate of returns and number and value of orders, as well as other factors. For more detail, please see this page.
Delivery 
Before you finalise your order, you'll be given various delivery options to choose from with estimated delivery time and dates depending on the delivery address. 
Orders are generally shipped to your delivery address from a designated warehouse. If part of your order is shipped from one of the other warehouses in our global network, this part of your order will be delivered by Standard Delivery. You'll see your estimated delivery date at the checkout. 
You'll only be charged one delivery fee for all items, even if they're coming from different warehouses.
All delivery services we offer for all ASOS items will also be available for items sold by an ASOS Brand Partner and shipped by ASOS. 
Next Day Delivery and ASOS Premier will not be available for items that are sold and shipped directly by ASOS Brand Partners and you won't be able to select Click & Collect delivery for your order. However, you won't be charged for delivery for these items. 
To see more about how delivery works with ASOS Brand Partners, just click here.
We work our ASOS socks off to try to meet all delivery times but sometimes there may be delays, e.g. because of postal/carrier delays, logistics or bad weather. We will keep you updated as much as we can and you should be able to track your parcel's progress. 
ASOS cannot be held liable for any parcels that are lost or stolen as a result of any specific delivery instructions left for the carrier.
Please check out our Delivery and Returns Page for more info. Any problems with your delivery? Please let us know within 30 days of the date which your order should have been delivered and we'll do our best to help you.
Returns and refunds 
Check out our returns and refunds policy here.
Please note that nothing in this Returns Policy affects your statutory rights, including your right to cancel your entire order under The Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013. Please follow this link for more info on how to cancel your order.
Returning unwanted ASOS products or items that were sold by an ASOS Brand Partner and shipped by ASOS? 
We get it, sometimes something just doesn't work for you and you want your money back. Don't worry, as long as an item is still in its original condition, we accept returns for free, subject to the rules below, which includes rules around Fair Use. 
If you return an item requesting a refund within 28 days of the item being delivered to you or available for collection, we'll give you a full refund by way of the original payment method. Where you purchased Brand Partner products, you authorise ASOS Payments to make the applicable refund to the original funding method you used to credit your ASOS Payments account. 
We aim to refund you within 14 days of receiving the returned item. 
If you request a refund for an item during the above time frames but you can't return it to us for some reason, please get in touch, but any refund will be at our discretion.
All returns and refunds for items are subject to our ASOS Returns Policy and the "Keep it Clean" and Original Condition" sections below. 
Returning unwanted items that were sold and shipped by an ASOS Brand Partner? 
Returning items that were sold and shipped by an ASOS Brand Partner is easy! You should have received returns instructions in your original parcel with all the details, most orders will have come with a pre-printed returns label. Just mark off the item/s you're returning and check your returns instructions for where to return the parcel. 
If you can't find your returns label, get in touch with us and we'll arrange for one to be sent to you. 
Make sure you send any items sold and shipped from an ASOS Brand Partner straight back to them, as returning them to ASOS will cause delays with your refund. 
ASOS and ASOS Payments do not accept responsibility for any items sold and shipped by an ASOS Brand Partner that are returned to ASOS incorrectly. 
If you've returned an item sold and shipped by an ASOS Brand Partner, you won't be able to track your return, we'll let you know once it's been processed. 
For orders sold and shipped by an ASOS Brand Partner, please note the returns policy is at the brands discretion.
After that?
We don't accept returns for unwanted items after the relevant returns period above. If you try to make a return, we may elect to send it back to you and ask you to cover the delivery costs. 
What happens to my return if I ordered using Klarna or Clearpay?
If you've placed an order with Clearpay, Pay Later with Klarna or Pay Later in 3 with Klarna, you'll be paying for your order in regular instalments or within 30 days of it being placed. If you return an item within 28 days of it being delivered to you or available for collection, we'll give you a refund of the relevant amount (subject to any amounts retained in accordance with our Fair Use policy (see here for details).
Using Klarna or Pay Later in 3 with Klarna? Klarna's Pay in 3 / Pay in 30 days are unregulated credit agreements. Borrowing more than you can afford or paying late may negatively impact your financial status and ability to obtain credit. 18+, UK residents only. Subject to status. For Terms and Conditions, click here. Late fees apply.

Proof of postage
For ASOS products and items that were sold by an ASOS Brand Partner and shipped by ASOS, we strongly recommend you get proof of postage and follow our returns process (for more information on how to return, see here). Our returns address is aSOS DC2, GXO Logistics, Armthorpe, Doncaster, DN3 3FB, UK
For items that were sold and shipped by an ASOS Brand Partner, make sure you get proof of postage and keep hold of it, in case we or ASOS Payments need to see it later. 
Keep it clean
Hygiene and your and all of our customers' safety is super important, so certain items can't be returned for refunds including face, Body products if opened, used or protective seal is not intact
Hygiene and your and all of our customers' safety is super important, so certain items can't be returned for refunds including sexual Wellness products if opened, used or protective seal is not intact
Hygiene and your and all of our customers' safety is super important, so certain items can't be returned for refunds including underwear if the hygiene seal is not intact or any labels have been broken
Hygiene and your and all of our customers' safety is super important, so certain items can't be returned for refunds including swimwear if the hygiene seal is not intact or any labels have been broken
Hygiene and your and all of our customers' safety is super important, so certain items can't be returned for refunds including pierced jewellery if the seal has been tampered with or is broken.
None of this affects your statutory rights.
Original condition
All returned items should be sent back to us in their original condition together with the original packaging and all ASOS and brand tags.
Footwear, only try on footwear on carpeted floors to protect the soles. They must also be returned with the original box (if any) and any original shoe or dust bags (if any).
All items are inspected on return. Of course, it's fine to try an item on like you would in a store, but don't actually wear or use it. When trying on clothing please be careful with the item (don't use unnecessary force) and don't wear make-up, perfume, cologne, deodorant or antiperspirant as these can mark and leave scents on the item.
If an item is returned to us worn, used, damaged or in an unsaleable condition, or where the above instructions have not been followed, we won't be able to give you a refund and we may have to send it back to you and ask you to cover the delivery costs. Alternatively, we (at our sole discretion) may choose to reduce your refund to reflect any reduction in the value of an item.
None of this affects your statutory rights.
Fair use Policy
Partial Refunds 
Our Fair Use Policy exists to ensure we can continue offering free returns to the vast majority of our customers. 
For the small group of customers who consistently take actions that make providing them with free returns unsustainable, we deduct and retain £3.95 from their refund to help cover the cost of getting the goods back to us. 
When deciding whether to make this deduction from your future refunds, we apply an objective formula based on your shopping behaviour, taking into account whether you have made particularly excessive returns well beyond the average ASOS customer's returns, as well as the number and value of orders made by you. 
If you fall into this group, you will still enjoy free returns when: you keep £40 or more of any order and are a non-Premier customer; or 
If you fall into this group, you will still enjoy free returns when: you keep £15 or more of any order and are a Premier customer. 
If this £3.95 deduction will apply to your future orders and refunds for returns, we will send you an initial e-mail notification. You will also see a message at the checkout and on returns pages, reminding you how much of the order you need to keep to avoid having £3.95 deducted from your refund. If you don't see these messages, good news! You'll continue to receive free returns on your orders. 
If you've placed an order with Klarna or Clearpay, you'll be paying for your order in regular instalments. If you return an item within 28 days of it being delivered to you, or available for collection, we'll arrange a refund to you of the relevant amount, with the return charge deducted (if applicable). 
ASOS has no liability to you for any instalments or additional charges incurred to Klarna or Clearpay, so make sure you pay them off in full! 
To find out more, click here for Pay Later in 3 with Klarna. 
Faulty and Incorrect Items 
You can continue to make free returns for products that are faulty or where we have sent you a product that you did not order. 
If your item has a fault, please return it to us as soon as possible so we can get this sorted for you. Don't forget to select 'Faulty/Broken' when selecting a reason for your return. Unable to create a return or your item is in an unreturnable condition? Please get in touch with our Customer Care team here and provide a photo of the faulty item, we'll be happy to help. 
Worn your favourite item one too many times? Please bear in mind that all items are inspected on return, and those with wear and tear rather than a fault will not be refunded. 
If you received a wrong item, please send it back to us as soon as you can. You'll need to select 'Incorrect Item Received' as the reason for return when creating your return. Find out how to return something here. Some brands have non-UK sizes displayed on products, so to check if you received the right size, please have a look at our size guide. 
PLEASE NOTE: If you have selected the category of return incorrectly or falsely, and we determine that the item is the correct item you ordered or does not in fact have a fault (as applicable), we reserve the right to charge you a returns fee. 
This section doesn't affect your statutory rights. 
Suspicious Activity 
If we suspect fraudulent activity and notice any unusual or suspicious activity with your account, we may refuse to issue a refund and suspend your account and any associated accounts. 
Such activities include, but are not limited to: complaints relating to unreceived orders, missing items, ordering and returning large quantities, much, much more than even the most loyal ASOS customer would order; unusual patterns of returns activity; if we suspect that someone is not just trying on their items, but wearing them for an extended period of time and then returning them; if we refuse multiple returns from you (see "When we may refuse a refund" below); or items are returned that are worn/used and do not correspond to the original order. 
If your account has been deactivated and you need to make a valid return, please see the account closure email we sent you. There you will find information on how to make a valid return. You will be responsible for the costs of returning the goods to us. All returns will be processed as usual once they reach our warehouse. 
Please note that we reserve the right to take legal action against you if the items you return do not match those you ordered. 
When we may withhold issuing a refund
We will refuse a return on grounds of hygiene (see 'Keep It Clean' above); or 
We will refuse a return if an item has been damaged, soiled , washed, altered or worn, or if the original tags or labels are no longer intact and/ or attached to the relevant item (see 'Original Condition' above); or
We will refuse a return if the items returned to us do not match what you received; or
We will refuse a return if you have returned items after expiry of the returns period (see 'Returning an unwanted item?' above).
If we refuse a return for any of these reasons, we will not issue you with a refund and we will send the items back to you. If you attempt to return a refused item a second time, we will dispose of the returned item in a responsible way and we will continue to withhold a refund. 
In certain cases, for example where we have had to refuse multiple returns by you, or there are suspicious circumstances relating to the return, we might also have to block your account and any associated accounts (see 'Fair Use' above). 
If any of the above happens to you and you think we've made a mistake, please get in touch with Customer Care and we'll be happy to discuss it with you. 
This does not affect your statutory rights. 
Promo Codes 
From time to time, we may give you Promo Codes that you can use to reduce the price of specified products. Remember, it's up to you to enter the code at checkout! 
Head over to our Customer Care pages for full details on Promo Codes and the rules on how to use them, but here are some key things to remember each Promo Code has its own terms, which will be made clear at the time it's issued to you (e.g. what products, single/multiple use, when it can be used etc).
Unless we tell you otherwise, Promo Codes can't be used to buy ASOS Premier, ASOS Gift Vouchers or on ASOS Marketplace.
Promo Codes, including student discounts, can't be applied to any items sold by ASOS Brand Partners. More details on students Ts&Cs, including any further exclusions that may apply, can be found here.
If you're given a unique Promo Code that is meant just for you (e.g. a student Promo Code) please keep it secret and don't let anyone else use it or abuse it (e.g. don't post it on social media). If we think there is or has been misuse of a Promo Code in any way (e.g. selling it or sharing it with others), we can cancel your Promo Code and suspend or even close your account without telling you. 
We don't like to do this, but if a Promo Code can't run properly because someone or something is spoiling the fun for everyone, e.g. fraud, tampering, technical errors or anything else that is beyond our control that affects the running or fairness of the Promo Code, we can cancel, modify or suspend the Promo Code. 
Promotional discounts may be offered to you on the basis of automated decision making. This type of decision making can result in you receiving certain promotions that other ASOS shoppers may not receive and vice versa. This decision making is never done on the basis of protected characteristics such as race or gender. Automated decision making is based on your previous browsing and shopping history only. We will tell you via the email containing your discount code if you have received a promotional discount on the basis of automated decision making. More information on how we use your data can be found in our privacy policy.
You have the right to ask us to explain any computer-system decision about you, which can be done by contacting us.
Gift Vouchers and Gift Cards 
If you're the lucky recipient of an ASOS Gift Voucher or ASOS Gift Card (high five!) head over to our Help pages to find out how and when your gift card or voucher can be used. A few points to bear in mind it's best to lock your Gift Voucher or Gift Card to your ASOS account ASAP to keep it safe.
Gift Vouchers and Gift Cards can't be used to buy ASOS Gift Vouchers or on ASOS Marketplace. They can only be used to buy ASOS products, or to load credits to your ASOS Payments account in order to pay for ASOS Brand Partner products in the way described above (please see the "Placing an order" section above). 
If you're being super generous and buying someone else an ASOS Gift Voucher, please make sure you get their email address correct! If you get it wrong and the Gift Voucher is emailed to someone else who uses it, there's not much we can do. Check, double check and even triple check before you buy it.
Speaking of emails, sometimes pesky (but useful) spam filters send our emails into junk or spam folders. So, if you've not been thanked for your generous gift, it's worth giving them a nudge because there might be something wonderful waiting for them in their junk or spam folder!
Gift vouchers bought with UK as the browsing country will expire 2 years from the date of receipt. Gift vouchers bought with the US as the browsing country do not have an expiry date. Gift vouchers bought from an ASOS browsing country outside of the US or the UK will expire 10 years from the date of receipt.
ASOS reserves the right to cancel any Gift Vouchers in its sole discretion where fraud or misuse is suspected.
