Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user's device and are widely used in order to make websites work more efficiently, let you navigate between pages, remember your preferences, and / or generally improve your user experience.

They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around the site when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
