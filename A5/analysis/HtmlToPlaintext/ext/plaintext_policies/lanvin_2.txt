The Lanvin Mark, the us.lanvin.com website and its Content may not be modified, reproduced, represented, incorporated in a derivative work or otherwise, on any medium. Any reproduction in whole or in part of this content is strictly prohibited and may constitute an offense of infringement.

For more information on how Lanvin collects and processes the Customer's personal data as well as the rights the Customer has, they may peruse the Privacy Policy. 
ARTICLE 13, FORCE MAJEURE 
The Parties may not be considered liable if the non-performance or delay in the performance of any of their obligations, as described in the General Terms of Sale, results from a force majeure event including, without limitation, acts of God; flood, fire, earthquake, epidemics or other health emergencies, or explosion; war, invasion, hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot or other civil unrest; government order, law, or actions; embargoes or blockades in effect on or after the date of this Agreement; national or regional emergency; strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns, or other industrial disturbances; telecommunication breakdowns, power outages or shortages, lack of warehouse or storage space, inadequate transportation services, or inability or delay in obtaining supplies of adequate or suitable materials; and other events beyond the control of the Impacted Party.

ARTICLE 15, BINDING ARBITRATION 
Any controversy or claim arising out of your use of the us.lanvin.com website, these General Terms and Conditions of Sale, and our Privacy Policy shall be settled by binding arbitration before Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS"), in a location determined by the arbitrator as set forth herein (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for claimant), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties, in accordance with the procedural rules for commercial disputes set forth in the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS ("JAMS Rules and Procedures") then prevailing, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the JAMS Rules and Procedures. Please go to website_url_lnk to see a complete copy of the JAMS Rules and Procedures or to submit a claim for arbitration. In resolving a claim for arbitration, the arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. In the event that the claimant is able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Vendor will pay as much of the claimant's filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal (other than that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis), or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures established by JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal is that claims will not be arbitrated on a class, representative, or collective basis, or as a private attorney general on behalf of other persons similarly situated, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither claimant nor Vendor shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute. Upon filing a demand for arbitration, all parties to such arbitration shall have the right of discovery, which discovery shall be completed within sixty days after the demand for arbitration is made, unless further extended by mutual agreement of the parties. Disputes regarding the arbitrability of any claim shall be resolved by the arbitrator. The arbitration of disputes pursuant to this paragraph shall be in your individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. You may not bring any claim as a private attorney general on behalf of other similarly situated persons. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. By agreeing to the arbitration of disputes as set forth herein, you agree that you are waiving your right to a jury trial and limiting your right to appeal. Do not use this site if you do not agree to the foregoing binding arbitration provisions. 
ARTICLE 16- THE CUSTOMER'S ACCEPTANCE
