These companies and organisations will exclusively receive the personal data required to carry out the services and will not be authorised to use them for any other purpose.
Communication of personal data to the data supervisors

To understand how these companies process the user's personal data and, in the event, change the protection settings, you can consult the section dedicated to privacy on each digital platform listed in the Cookie Policy section.
The user's personal data may also be shared with third parties to host website content, provide technical and organisational services functional to the above purposes, keep customer's bank details, provide assistance in sending or managing marketing activities (in addition to the above) and manage emails, market analyses, surveys, competitions, reward schemes or promotions.

In both cases, the personal data will be feeded for the CRM purposes into our centralized and secured data base stored in Italy and is managed by our Customer Relationship Managers and marketing team in Italy and abroad.

This staff engaged to be bound by confidentiality obligations and expressly appointed as person in charge of the processing, as required by the applicable law. In particular, if you agreed to the processing of your personal data for the CRM purposes, the related data may be read, amended and updated by our staff and the staff at the, Boutiques, Points of Sales and local e-commerce vendors (especially the sales and marketing personnel). The staff is based in Italy or abroad, and is trained and bound by confidentiality obligations. We may use them, indeed, to collect, use and disclose the data as instructed by us.
If we need to transfer the personal data abroad for achieving the purposes of this Privacy Policy, including where the data protection legislation differs from the one applicable in your country, we take steps to ensure that these communications happen in compliance with the European data protection standards, or other local standards in the country where we collect the data, so that your data remain secure and confidential.
