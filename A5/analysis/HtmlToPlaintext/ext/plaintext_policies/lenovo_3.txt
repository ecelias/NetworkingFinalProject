PLEASE READ THE LENOVO SALES AGREEMENT BELOW CAREFULLY. THIS "AGREEMENT" IS WHAT LENOVO CALLS OUR "SALES TERMS & CONDITIONS" ON LENOVO. COM. BY PLACING AN ORDER ON LENOVO. COM OR ACCEPTING PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ("YOU" OR "CUSTOMER") ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT; UNDERSTAND IT; AND THAT YOU AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO A REQUIREMENT THAT DISPUTES MUST BE RESOLVED IN BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, NOT IN COURT. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION AND PRETRIAL DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE RIGHTS ARE MORE LIMITED THAN IN COURT. YOU HAVE A LIMITED-TIME RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS REQUIREMENT. SEE THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT PAGE FOR FULL DETAILS AND OPT-OUT INSTRUCTIONS. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PERSON OR A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND THAT PERSON, COMPANY, OR LEGAL ENTITY TO THIS AGREEMENT.
Lenovo Sales Agreement
Unless there is a different written sales agreement in place between Lenovo and Customer, this Agreement, including associated warranty statements, license agreements, and any applicable attachments, is the sole and complete agreement between Customer and Lenovo regarding the Products or Services purchased by Customer. Any additional or different terms in any order or communication from Customer shall not be binding on Lenovo unless signed by an authorized representative of Lenovo.
Products and Services purchased on Lenovo's website, Lenovo.com are subject to the US Export Administration Regulations. They are for Customer's own use within the territory in which they are purchased and may not be resold except by an Authorized Lenovo Reseller, exported or reexported to other territories. Lenovo reserves the right to refuse or cancel any order in which Lenovo suspects the Customer is purchasing Products or Services for the purpose of reselling or exporting them. By moving forward with this order, you confirm that you agree you will not resell, export or reexport all Products and Services in violation of this agreement.
Customer accepts the terms of this Agreement when ordering online on Lenovo.com or, when ordering by any other means, by opening the package containing the product or accepting a Service from Lenovo. Placing on order on Lenovo.com or inputting information on Lenovo.com does not mean Lenovo has accepted an order through its website. Lenovo only accepts Customer's order by shipping the hardware Product or making the software Product available to Customer; or providing the Service. Confirmation of receipt of Customer's order placed on Lenovo.com shall not mean Lenovo has accepted Customer's order.
Definitions
Product shall mean any Lenovo branded or third party hardware or software that Lenovo provides to Customer under this Agreement. Hardware products include computers and accessories. Software products include computer software programs (whether pre-loaded, provided separately, or provided as a subscription service) and related licensed materials such as documentation.
Service is the performance of a task; provision of advice or assistance; or access to a resource such as access to an information data base that Lenovo makes available to Customer.
Prices, Payment, and Errors
Except for credit or debit card transactions, or if not paid in advance of shipment, payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Any amounts not received by Lenovo within thirty days of receipt of invoice shall be overdue. Customer shall pay a late payment fee of the lesser of one and one half (1.5%) percent per month or the maximum rate permitted by law on the undisputed overdue balance of the invoice amount. Customer shall pay any applicable sales, use or similar taxes, fees or duties unless Customer provides exemption documentation to Lenovo. Customer is responsible for taxes, if any, on Products from the date Lenovo ships them to Customer or on Services, on the date the Services are provided by Lenovo. No other discounts, quantity entitlements, or promotions apply unless agreed in writing by Lenovo. Delivery charges, if applicable, will be as specified in an invoice.
If Lenovo makes an error in pricing information and a typographic error on Lenovo.com or otherwise in any advertisements or in any communications with Customer, Lenovo may nevertheless refuse or cancel an order placed for a Product or Service quoted at such price or described in error, even if Lenovo has confirmed the receipt of Customer's order or charged Customer's credit or debit card. If Lenovo has charged Customer's credit or debit card, Lenovo will issue a credit to Customer's credit or debit card account in the amount of the charge.
Electronically Delivered Software Products.
In the case of electronically delivered software Products, Customer will receive an email with an activation key and download link. Customer shall be responsible for downloading the software Product and bear risk of loss relating thereto, including the failure of a computer, hard drive, or internet connection. In the case of software provided as a subscription service, Lenovo shall provide instructions on how to access such services. Internet or other connection charges in connection with the download, access, and use of the software Product shall be Customer's sole responsibility.
Returns
Customer may return an eligible Product in its original package to Lenovo for a full refund, less any applicable return shipping and handling fees and any applicable restocking fees as stated below. Customer may only return the entire Product or all such Products for a refund. For purchases from Lenovo.com, all requests for returns must be submitted within 30 calendar days from the date of invoice. For purchases from Lenovo Outlet, all requests for returns must be submitted within 14 calendar days from the date of invoice. For purchases from LenovoPRO, all requests for returns must be submitted within 45 calendar days from the date of invoice. For purchases of Motorola Products, all requests for returns must be submitted within 14 calendar days from the date of invoice. Unless Lenovo ships the wrong Products or makes an error in the configuration of the Products ordered, returns of purchases of: server and storage products; orders for personal computing products in quantities greater than five units; and Products submitted outside the allotted calendar days from the date of invoice, are subject to a restocking fee of 15% of the price paid and return shipping and handling fees. Digital gaming products; partial refunds or credits for Products, including installation of software Product options; or quantities of Products that are not separately priced, are not available for return. To request a return, Customer must contact Lenovo to obtain an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) number. Any authorized return must include the Product and all accessories in their original packaging. It must be received at the Lenovo National Return Center within 10 calendar days of issuance of the RMA. Returns on any other basis may be refused by Lenovo. Customer assumes risk of loss and damage for Products returned without an RMA. Upon receipt of your returned Product, Lenovo will issue a credit or refund of the purchase price paid, less any applicable return shipping and handling fees and any applicable restocking fees.
Software delivered electronically cannot be returned at any point.
Warranties
Lenovo hardware Products are warranted in accordance with the Lenovo Limited Warranty accompanying each Lenovo hardware Product or as found at: website_url_lnk incorporated herein by reference. The Lenovo Limited Warranty applies only to Lenovo hardware Products purchased for Customer's own use and does not transfer upon resale.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LENOVO MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTIES FOR LENOVO HARDWARE PRODUCTS, AND LENOVO MAKES NO WARRANTIES FOR SOFTWARE, SERVICE, SUPPORT OR THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS. SUCH SOFTWARE, SERVICE, SUPPORT AND PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND. THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OF SOFTWARE, SERVICES, PRODUCTS AND SUPPORT MAY PROVIDE WARRANTIES TO CUSTOMER.
Title and Risk of Loss
Lenovo transfers title to hardware Products to Customer upon delivery to Lenovo's designated carrier shipping the Products to Customer. Lenovo does not transfer title to Programs.
Lenovo shall bear the risk of loss or damage to hardware Products until they are delivered to Lenovo's designated carrier for shipment to Customer. Thereafter, Customer assumes risk of loss or damage. Hardware Products will be covered by insurance, arranged and provided by Lenovo for Customer, covering the period until they are delivered to Customer.

To perform its obligations pursuant to this Agreement, Lenovo may transfer Customer Information: from any country to any other country in the world where Lenovo does business, and to service providers acting on Lenovo's behalf in relation to this Agreement.

EXCEPT FOR BODILY INJURY (INCLUDING DEATH) AND DAMAGE TO REAL PROPERTY OR TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LENOVO SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL DIRECT DAMAGES SUFFERED BY CUSTOMER, UP TO THE AMOUNT CUSTOMER PAID FOR THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE.
Force Majeure. Lenovo shall not be liable to Customer for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder, to the extent such failure or delay is caused by fire, flood, earthquakes, other elements of nature; acts of war; terrorism, riots, civil disorders, rebellions or revolutions; epidemics, communication line or power failures; governmental laws, court orders or regulations; or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of Lenovo.
Product Changes. Lenovo may change or discontinue Products at any time. In such event, Lenovo may fulfill Customer's order with a Product that has substantially the same functionality and performance as the Product ordered by Customer.

Neither You nor Lenovo may bring an action arising out of or related to this Sales Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose.
Individual State Disclosures. THIS SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO SALE OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO CONSUMERS
IN NEW JERSEY: You and Lenovo expressly agree that the limitation of warranties in Section and the limitation on liability in Section of this Agreement, as modified by this Section 7.7, are intended to be as broad and inclusive as is permitted by the law of the State of New Jersey and that if any portion thereof is held invalid, it is agreed that the balance shall, notwithstanding, continue in full force and effect. Notwithstanding any language in Section of this Agreement to the contrary, Lenovo agrees that the limitation on liability for actions under or related to this Agreement will not apply to claims brought by New Jersey consumers for damages caused by Lenovo's intentional, reckless or grossly negligent conduct. If one or more other provisions of this Agreement are deemed to be illegal or unenforceable under New Jersey law, the remainder of this Agreement shall be unaffected and shall continue to be fully valid, binding and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
