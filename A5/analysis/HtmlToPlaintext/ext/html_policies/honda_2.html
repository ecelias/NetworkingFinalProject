Please also note that this Site may contain hyperlinks to separate websites, such as world.honda.com, that are owned and operated by our parent company, Honda Motor Co., Ltd. to which these terms and conditions do not apply.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><em>General Provisions</em></h3>
<p>THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS TOGETHER WITH THE <a href="privacy-notice">PRIVACY NOTICE</a>, ANY SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS, CONDITIONS, OR RULES POSTED TO A SPECIFIC AREA OF THIS SITE (COLLECTIVELY “TERMS”) SET FORTH THE LEGALLY BINDING TERMS GOVERNING YOUR USE OF THIS SITE.</p>
<p>By entering this Site, you acknowledge and agree to all terms, conditions, and rules stated in these Terms. You are not permitted to use this Site if you do not agree to be legally bound by these Terms. Please read these Terms carefully.</p>
<p>We may, in our sole discretion, modify these Terms from time to time and we reserve the right to make changes at any time, without notice or obligation, to any of the content and information contained on this Site, including but not limited to automobile colors, specifications, accessories, models, materials or other product or service features. By entering this Site, or continuing your relationship with us after such revisions, you acknowledge and agree that you shall be bound by any such revisions. We suggest periodically visiting this page of the Site to review these Terms.</p>
<h3><em>Jurisdiction and Governing Law</em></h3>
<p>American Honda makes no representations that the information and materials contained within this Site are appropriate for locations outside the United States. By entering this Site, you acknowledge and agree that, unless otherwise expressly stated, this Site is intended for use within the United States only by users sixteen years of age or older and will only be governed according to the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflicts of laws principles.

If you use this Site from other locations you are responsible for compliance with all applicable local laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><em>Disclaimer of Warranties</em></h3>
<p>This Site, and all information and materials contained herein, is provided to you on an "AS IS" and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, and AT YOUR OWN RISK TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. Although the specifications, features, illustrations, equipment, warranties, service manuals, recalls, safety tips, and other information contained in the Site are based upon up-to-date information, and while American Honda and all parties involved in creating, producing, or delivering this Site make all reasonable efforts to ensure that all material on this Site is correct, accuracy cannot be guaranteed. WE DISCLAIM, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ALL WARRANTIES REGARDING SECURITY, CURRENCY, CORRECTNESS, QUALITY, ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, RELIABILITY, PERFORMANCE, TIMELINESS, OR CONTINUED AVAILABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THIS SITE. We expressly disclaim, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any warranties with respect to any downtime, delays or errors in the transmission or delivery of any information, materials, or services through the Site. To the extent any jurisdiction does not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, some of the above exclusions do not apply.</p>
<h3><em>General Product, Services, and Financing Information</em></h3>
<p>This Site provides information, including but not limited to specific product pricing, product specifications, used car values, service contracts, budget calculators, financial calculators, current financing offers, and basic company information for informational purposes only and nothing contained herein constitutes financial advice or an offer to sell, finance, or lease a specific product or service to you unless otherwise expressly acknowledged and apparent from the particular content.</p>
<p>The MSRPs (manufacturer's suggested retail price) listed on this Site exclude tax, title, license, registration, destination charge, options and any dealer documentary fees. Dealers set actual prices. All trade-in values obtained from Kelley Blue Book are estimates and the actual value of the vehicle may be higher or lower depending upon the condition of your vehicle, equipment and local market conditions. For some newer models, Kelley Blue Book may not have enough data to provide a trade-in value.</p>
<p>Our financial calculators’ estimated payments exclude applicable taxes, title, registration, license, and documentary fees. The current finance or lease options are offered only on approved credit through Honda Financial Services or Acura Financial Services, may not be available in all areas of the United States, and not all Honda and Acura dealers may participate in these programs. Current offers do not constitute an offer of direct financing or of any particular lease or purchase transaction. Rates and requirements vary based on geographic location and credit worthiness.</p>
<p>This Site also posts certified used car inventories provided from individual authorized Honda and Acura certified used car dealers. You acknowledge that American Honda is neither responsible nor guarantees the accuracy of any information provided and that all vehicles are subject to prior sale. You understand that dealers set their own prices, all prices and specifications are subject to change without notice, and prices may not include additional fees such as government fees and taxes, title and registration fees, finance charges, dealer document preparation fees, processing fees, and emission testing and compliance charges.</p>
<p>As a result, this Site shall not be used or relied upon by you as a substitute for information that is available to you from a third party advisor or from an authorized Honda or Acura dealer.</p>
<h3><em>American Honda’s Intellectual Property</em></h3>
<p>American Honda will aggressively enforce its intellectual property rights to the full extent of the law. All images, text, sound, photos, custom graphics, button icons, the collection and compilation and assembly thereof, and the overall “look and feel” and distinctiveness of the Site constitute trade dress and are either the property of American Honda or used on this Site with permission. The absence on the Site of our name or logo does not constitute a waiver of our trademark or other intellectual property rights relating to such name or logo. All other product names, company names, marks, logos, and symbols appearing on the Site may be the trademarks and the property of their respective owners.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that information, and services available on the Site are protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, or other proprietary rights and laws and are owned or licensed by American Honda.

<h3><em>Limitation of Liability</em></h3>
<p>By using this Site you agree that, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, none of the parties involved in creating, producing, or delivering this Site is liable for any direct, incidental, consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, or any other losses, costs, or expenses or any kind which may arise, directly or indirectly, through the access to, use of, implementation of, or browsing of this Site or through your downloading of any materials, data, text, images, video or audio from this Site, including but not limited to anything caused by any viruses, bugs, or any computer system, phone line, hardware, software or program malfunctions, or any other errors, failures or delays in computer transmissions or network connections.</p>
<h3><em>Dispute Resolution</em></h3>
<p>Any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Site, including, but not limited to, alleged violations of state or federal statutory or common law rights or duties (a “Dispute”) shall be solely and exclusively resolved according to the procedures set forth in this paragraph. If the parties are unable to resolve any Dispute through informal means, either party may initiate binding arbitration of such Dispute by sending notice demanding arbitration to the other party. The demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the Dispute has arisen, but in no event shall it be made more than one year from when the aggrieved party knew or should have known of the controversy, claim or facts forming the basis of the Dispute. The arbitration shall be initiated and conducted according to American Arbitration Association rules and procedures for consumer arbitration (the “Arbitration Rules”), including its provisions permitting Disputes falling within the jurisdiction of small claims court to be filed in small claims court. The arbitration shall be conducted in Los Angeles County, California before a single neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules with the option to appeal the arbitrator’s decision to Optional Appellate Arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. Disputes with an amount in controversy under $10,000 will be decided by the arbitrator solely upon written submissions without a hearing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive, special, exemplary, consequential, incidental, or indirect damages against any party. Arbitration costs and fees shall be determined in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. Attorneys’ fees shall be borne by each party independently and no party shall be liable for the attorneys’ fees of the other party. No disputes may be arbitrated on a class or representative basis and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO JOIN CLAIMS OR DISPUTES WITH THOSE OF OTHERS IN THE FORM OF A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR SIMILAR PROCEDURAL DEVICE; AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO PRESENT ITS CLAIM OR DISPUTE IN A COURT OF LAW. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s), if any, may be entered for enforcement purposes in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Subject to the dispute resolution process described above, all claims, disputes, and suits (including Disputes filed in small claims court pursuant to the Arbitration Rules) must be brought solely in the state or federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California, and you agree to the jurisdiction thereof.</p>
<h3><em>Indemnity</em></h3>
