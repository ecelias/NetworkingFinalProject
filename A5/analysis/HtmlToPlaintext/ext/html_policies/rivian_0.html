<h3 id="dispute-binding-arbitration">Binding Arbitration</h3>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and except for small claims or if you choose to opt-out as provided below, this Section governs all Disputes between you and Rivian. The term “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced and means any dispute, demand, claim, or controversy of any kind between you and Rivian, whether based in contract, tort, statute, or otherwise, including but not limited to any claim for fraud, false advertising, misrepresentation, strict products liability, negligence, breach of contract, breach of express or implied warranties, or violations of consumer protection, privacy or data security laws, that arises out of or in any way relates to (1) this Agreement; (2) our relationship (including any such relationship with affiliate third parties who did not sign this Agreement); (3) the purchase, sale, condition, design, or manufacturing of the Vehicle; (4) Rivian products or services; (5) advertising and other communications between you and Rivian; and as applicable, (6) your credit application. You and Rivian agree to resolve all Disputes by binding arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, unless you and we agree otherwise. For more information on arbitration and to access the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, please visit: <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>.  If the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules conflict with this Agreement, then this Agreement shall control. You and we understand that we are both waiving our rights to go to court (other than small claims court, as provided below), to present our claims to a jury and to have claims resolved by a jury trial, and also that judicial appeal rights, if any, are more limited in arbitration than they would be in court.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-confidentiality">Confidentiality</h3>
<p>Arbitrations conducted under this Section shall be kept strictly confidential. Neither you or Rivian may disclose the fact that an arbitration exists or is proceeding, the nature or content of the Dispute(s), all documents exchanged in connection with the arbitration, all testimony (including transcripts of testimony, if any) that is given in the arbitration proceeding, or the results of any arbitration award. This paragraph shall not prevent disclosure of the arbitration proceedings: (1) as may be required by law or court order; (2) as may be required to judicially challenge or enforce an arbitration award; (3) as may be required to assist your or Rivian’s legal counsel, financial advisors, or accountants—provided that such individuals are also bound by this Section; (4) as may be required to disclose to existing or future shareholders, existing or potential insurers or reinsurers, existing or potential investors, existing or potential lenders, or existing or potential purchasers; or (5) if you and Rivian provide prior written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this paragraph shall not apply to claims where confidentiality clauses are made illegal under state or federal law. The arbitrator shall have jurisdiction to hear any disputes over a breach of this Section and shall have authority to fashion an appropriate remedy. The arbitrator shall retain jurisdiction to enforce this Section after arbitration has ended. </p>
<h3 id="dispute-initial-dispute-resolution-requirement">Initial Dispute Resolution Requirement</h3>
<p>Most disputes can be resolved without resort to arbitration or small claims court. For any Dispute, you and we agree that before taking any formal action to initiate arbitration or a small claims suit we will contact the other in an attempt to resolve the Dispute. You will contact us at <a href="mailto:demands@rivian.com">demands@rivian.com</a> and provide a brief, written description of the Dispute and your contact information (including your Rivian ID, if you have one). We will contact you at your contact information on file with Rivian. You and Rivian agree to use reasonable efforts to settle any Dispute directly and good faith negotiations shall be a pre-condition to either party initiating a small claims suit or arbitration. </p>
<h3 id="dispute-filing-a-demand-for-arbitration">Filing a Demand for Arbitration</h3>
<p>If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of 60 days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, you must file an arbitration demand with AAA. You can find information about AAA and file your arbitration demand at <a href="https://www.adr.org/Support">https://www.adr.org/Support</a>. You are also required to send a copy of the arbitration demand to us and you should send it by email to: <a href="mailto:arbitration@rivian.com">arbitration@rivian.com</a>.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-fees--costs">Fees &amp; Costs</h3>
<p>AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules will govern the allocation of arbitration fees and costs between you and Rivian. However, if your arbitration case filing fee exceeds the filing fee you would pay to file the action in a court of law, Rivian will pay the amount of your case filing fee in excess of the filing fee you would pay in a court of law. The amount we pay may be reimbursed in whole or in part by decision of the arbitrator if s/he finds that applicable law allows such reimbursement because your claims were frivolous or brought in bad faith. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless applicable law provides otherwise. </p>
<h3 id="dispute-arbitration-location-and-procedure">Arbitration Location and Procedure</h3>
<p>Arbitration shall be initiated and take place in the city or county of your residence unless you and Rivian agree otherwise, or, if you reside outside of the United States, in Orange County, California. If your claim does not exceed $25,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Rivian submit to the arbitrator. If your claim exceeds $25,000, you and Rivian may agree to conduct arbitration by videoconference or teleconference or conduct a document-only arbitration without any hearing. The arbitrator will have discretion to require a telephonic or face-to-face hearing for any claim upon the request of a party.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-applicable-law">Applicable Law</h3>
<p>You and Rivian agree that both the substantive and procedural provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”), shall govern the subject matter, formation, procedure, and enforcement of this Section. The statute of limitations laws, including statutes of repose, of the State in which the selling Rivian dealership on the first page of this Agreement is located, without regard to choice or conflict of law principles, will apply to any claims brought in arbitration.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-arbitrators-powers">Arbitrator’s Powers</h3>
<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Section, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Section is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall also have exclusive authority to resolve all threshold issues of arbitrability, including whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration, issues relating to whether this Section is applicable, unconscionable, or illusory, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel. However, the parties agree that any issue concerning the validity of the class action waiver below must be decided by a court, and an arbitrator does not have authority to consider the validity of the waiver. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available to you in your individual capacity in a court under law or in equity, including public injunctive relief. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and shall be binding on you and Rivian. To preserve the confidentiality of the arbitration proceedings, the arbitrator’s award shall not be entered as judgment in a court of law, unless you or Rivian fail to voluntarily satisfy the arbitration award within sixty (60) days after the arbitration award has been rendered.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-class-action-waiver">Class Action Waiver</h3>
<p>The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in each party’s respective individual capacity only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND RIVIAN AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, NEITHER YOU NOR RIVIAN WILL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER CONSUMERS IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. If a court (after exhaustion of all appeals) declares any of this Class Action Waiver unenforceable, then all other aspects of the case must be arbitrated first. After completing arbitration, the remaining (non-arbitrable) aspects of the case will then be decided by a court.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-small-claims-court">Small Claims Court</h3>
<p>Subject to the Initial Dispute Resolution Requirement, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional limits that apply to that forum. &nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="dispute-opt-out-right">Opt-Out Right</h3>
<p>You may opt-out of this Dispute Resolution – Arbitration and Class Action Waiver within 30 days from the date you electronically sign this Agreement, by sending an email to <a href="mailto:optout@rivian.com">optout@rivian.com</a> from the email associated with your Rivian ID with “Opt-Out of Arbitration” in the subject line and, in the body of the email, your full name and address. Any opt-out of this provision does not affect the validity of any other arbitration agreement between you and Rivian. If you opt out of this provision and at the time you sign this Agreement you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate disputes with Rivian, that existing arbitration agreement will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-severability">Severability</h3>
<p>If any arbitrator or court determines that any part of this Dispute Resolution – Arbitration and Class Action Waiver is illegal or unenforceable, then such part will be eliminated and the remainder of the Dispute Resolution – Arbitration and Class Action Waiver will remain in force and effect and the unenforceable part shall be deemed to be modified solely to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-survival">Survival</h3>
<p>This Dispute Resolution – Arbitration and Class Action Waiver shall survive the end of this Agreement and/or your relationship with Rivian, including the end of any promotion or contest, opt-out of communication or other use or participation in any Rivian Product or Service.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-choice-of-forum">Choice of Forum</h3>
<p>Any Dispute(s) deemed not subject to arbitration shall be litigated exclusively by either party in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. If the United States District Court for the Central District of California lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any Dispute(s) deemed not subject to arbitration shall be litigated exclusively by either party in the Superior Court of the State of California in the County of Orange.</p>

<li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit Rivian to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address;</li>
<li>A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>
<li>A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate that you’re authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>

<ul>
<li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
<li>Identification of the User Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the User Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>

Dispute Resolution – Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver \n\n### Binding Arbitration\nTo the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and except for small claims or if you choose to opt-out as provided below, this Section governs all Disputes between you and Rivian. The term “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced and means any dispute, demand, claim, or controversy of any kind between you and Rivian, whether based in contract, tort, statute, or otherwise, including but not limited to any claim for fraud, false advertising, misrepresentation, strict products liability, negligence, breach of contract, breach of express or implied warranties, or violations of consumer protection, privacy or data security laws, that arises out of or in any way relates to (1) this Agreement; (2) our relationship (including any such relationship with affiliate third parties who did not sign this Agreement); (3) the purchase, sale, condition, design, or manufacturing of the Vehicle; (4) Rivian products or services; (5) advertising and other communications between you and Rivian; and as applicable, (6) your credit application. You and Rivian agree to resolve all Disputes by binding arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, unless you and we agree otherwise. For more information on arbitration and to access the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, please visit: www.adr.org.  If the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules conflict with this Agreement, then this Agreement shall control. You and we understand that we are both waiving our rights to go to court (other than small claims court, as provided below), to present our claims to a jury and to have claims resolved by a jury trial, and also that judicial appeal rights, if any, are more limited in arbitration than they would be in court.\n\n### Confidentiality\n\nArbitrations conducted under this Section shall be kept strictly confidential. Neither you or Rivian may disclose the fact that an arbitration exists or is proceeding, the nature or content of the Dispute(s), all documents exchanged in connection with the arbitration, all testimony (including transcripts of testimony, if any) that is given in the arbitration proceeding, or the results of any arbitration award. This paragraph shall not prevent disclosure of the arbitration proceedings: (1) as may be required by law or court order; (2) as may be required to judicially challenge or enforce an arbitration award; (3) as may be required to assist your or Rivian’s legal counsel, financial advisors, or accountants—provided that such individuals are also bound by this Section; (4) as may be required to disclose to existing or future shareholders, existing or potential insurers or reinsurers, existing or potential investors, existing or potential lenders, or existing or potential purchasers; or (5) if you and Rivian provide prior written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this paragraph shall not apply to claims where confidentiality clauses are made illegal under state or federal law. The arbitrator shall have jurisdiction to hear any disputes over a breach of this Section and shall have authority to fashion an appropriate remedy. The arbitrator shall retain jurisdiction to enforce this Section after arbitration has ended. \n\n### Initial Dispute Resolution Requirement \n\nMost disputes can be resolved without resort to arbitration or small claims court. For any Dispute, you and we agree that before taking any formal action to initiate arbitration or a small claims suit we will contact the other in an attempt to resolve the Dispute. You will contact us at demands@rivian.com and provide a brief, written description of the Dispute and your contact information (including your Rivian ID, if you have one). We will contact you at your contact information on file with Rivian. You and Rivian agree to use reasonable efforts to settle any Dispute directly and good faith negotiations shall be a pre-condition to either party initiating a small claims suit or arbitration. \n\n### Filing a Demand for Arbitration \n\nIf the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of 60 days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, you must file an arbitration demand with AAA. You can find information about AAA and file your arbitration demand at https://www.adr.org/Support. You are also required to send a copy of the arbitration demand to us and you should send it by email to: arbitration@rivian.com.\n\n### Fees \u0026 Costs\n\nAAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules will govern the allocation of arbitration fees and costs between you and Rivian. However, if your arbitration case filing fee exceeds the filing fee you would pay to file the action in a court of law, Rivian will pay the amount of your case filing fee in excess of the filing fee you would pay in a court of law. The amount we pay may be reimbursed in whole or in part by decision of the arbitrator if s/he finds that applicable law allows such reimbursement because your claims were frivolous or brought in bad faith. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless applicable law provides otherwise. \n\n### Arbitration Location and Procedure\n\nArbitration shall be initiated and take place in the city or county of your residence unless you and Rivian agree otherwise, or, if you reside outside of the United States, in Orange County, California. If your claim does not exceed $25,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Rivian submit to the arbitrator. If your claim exceeds $25,000, you and Rivian may agree to conduct arbitration by videoconference or teleconference or conduct a document-only arbitration without any hearing. The arbitrator will have discretion to require a telephonic or face-to-face hearing for any claim upon the request of a party.\n\n### Applicable Law\n\nYou and Rivian agree that both the substantive and procedural provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”), shall govern the subject matter, formation, procedure, and enforcement of this Section. The statute of limitations laws, including statutes of repose, of the State in which the selling Rivian dealership on the first page of this Agreement is located, without regard to choice or conflict of law principles, will apply to any claims brought in arbitration.\n\n### Arbitrator’s Powers\n\nThe arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Section, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Section is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall also have exclusive authority to resolve all threshold issues of arbitrability, including whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration, issues relating to whether this Section is applicable, unconscionable, or illusory, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel. However, the parties agree that any issue concerning the validity of the class action waiver below must be decided by a court, and an arbitrator does not have authority to consider the validity of the waiver. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available to you in your individual capacity in a court under law or in equity, including public injunctive relief. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and shall be binding on you and Rivian. To preserve the confidentiality of the arbitration proceedings, the arbitrator’s award shall not be entered as judgment in a court of law, unless you or Rivian fail to voluntarily satisfy the arbitration award within sixty (60) days after the arbitration award has been rendered.\n\n### Class Action Waiver\n\nThe parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in each party’s respective individual capacity only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND RIVIAN AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, NEITHER YOU NOR RIVIAN WILL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER CONSUMERS IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. If a court (after exhaustion of all appeals) declares any of this Class Action Waiver unenforceable, then all other aspects of the case must be arbitrated first. After completing arbitration, the remaining (non-arbitrable) aspects of the case will then be decided by a court.\n\n### Small Claims Court \n\nSubject to the Initial Dispute Resolution Requirement, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional limits that apply to that forum.  \n\n### Opt-Out Right\n\nYou may opt-out of this Dispute Resolution – Arbitration and Class Action Waiver within 30 days from the date you electronically sign this Agreement, by sending an email to optout@rivian.com from the email associated with your Rivian ID with “Opt-Out of Arbitration” in the subject line and, in the body of the email, your full name and address. Any opt-out of this provision does not affect the validity of any other arbitration agreement between you and Rivian. If you opt out of this provision and at the time you sign this Agreement you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate disputes with Rivian, that existing arbitration agreement will remain in full force and effect.\n\n### Severability \n\nIf any arbitrator or court determines that any part of this Dispute Resolution – Arbitration and Class Action Waiver is illegal or unenforceable, then such part will be eliminated and the remainder of the Dispute Resolution – Arbitration and Class Action Waiver will remain in force and effect and the unenforceable part shall be deemed to be modified solely to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\n\n### Survival\n\nThis Dispute Resolution – Arbitration and Class Action Waiver shall survive the end of this Agreement and/or your relationship with Rivian, including the end of any promotion or contest, opt-out of communication or other use or participation in any Rivian Product or Service.\n\n### Choice of Forum\n\nAny Dispute(s) deemed not subject to arbitration shall be litigated exclusively by either party in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. If the United States District Court for the Central District of California lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any Dispute(s) deemed not subject to arbitration shall be litigated exclusively by either party in the Superior Court of the State of California in the County of Orange.\n","expandable":null},{"sys":{"id":"5cMJzcq8FyoTvLbjk2vTVj"},"entryTitle":"Terms - General - Rivian Account","title":null,"anchorSlug":"account","body":"## 3.
