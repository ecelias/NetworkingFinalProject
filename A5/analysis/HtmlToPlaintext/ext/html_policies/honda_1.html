                <br>
<p>American Honda Motor, Co., Inc. (“Honda”), the distributor of Acura and Honda vehicles in the United States, for a long time has taken most seriously the need to protect consumer privacy. With the growing application of in-vehicle technologies and services that can transmit personally identifiable information to Honda, its service providers, and, potentially, third parties to enhance the safety, performance, and driving experience of its customers, Honda has, along with other automakers, made a commitment about how it will collect, use, disclose, and hold such information. The Consumer Privacy Protection Principles for Vehicle Technologies and Services (the “Privacy Principles”) that are linked below reflect that commitment.</p>
<p>
The Privacy Principles provide a framework for how Honda will handle “Covered Information”&nbsp;it collects from vehicles or about vehicles or their operators, to the extent described in the Vehicle Data Privacy Notice below. The Privacy Principles provide additional, heightened protections for the most sensitive types of consumer in-vehicle data, such as geo-location, driver behavior, and vehicle operation and performance data.</p>
<p>Honda’s Commitments Under the Privacy Principles:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Honda commits to providing Owners and Registered Users of connected vehicle services with ready access to clear, meaningful notices about its collection, use, and disclosure of Covered Information. </li>
    <li><strong>Choice:</strong> Honda commits to offering Owners and Registered Users with certain choices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Covered Information.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect for Context:</strong> Honda commits to using and disclosing&nbsp;Covered Information in ways that are consistent with the context in which the Covered Information was collected, taking account of the likely impact on Owners and Registered Users.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Minimization, De-Identification &amp; Retention:</strong> Honda commits to collecting Covered Information only as needed for legitimate business purposes. Honda further commits to retaining Covered Information for only as long as it determines necessary for legitimate business purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> Honda commits to implementing reasonable measures to protect Covered Information against unauthorized access or use.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrity &amp; Access:</strong> Honda commits to implementing reasonable measures to maintain the accuracy of Covered Information and further commits to offering Owners and Registered Users reasonable means to review and correct Personal Subscription Information that they provide during the subscription or registration process for Vehicle Technologies and Services.</li>
    <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Honda commits to taking reasonable steps to ensure that it and other entities that receive Covered Information adhere to the Privacy Principles.</li>
</ul>
<p>
As part of the commitments under the Privacy Principles, Honda has established this webpage so consumers can access the American Honda Vehicle Data Privacy Notice, which explains how Honda collects, maintains, uses, and discloses Covered Information as part of vehicle technologies and services, and all other relevant documents related to Honda programs, technologies, and services whereby Covered Information may be collected, used, disclosed, or held by Honda.

<h4>Effective December 14, 2023</h4>
<p>Thank you for selecting a Honda or Acura vehicle. Your privacy is important to American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (“Honda”, “we”, “our”, “us”).

<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anonymized Information<br>
</span></h4>
<p>Information that has been&nbsp;anonymized, aggregated, or deidentified such that it is no longer reasonably capable of being associated with any person or vehicle&nbsp;does not qualify as Covered Information; therefore, we may use or disclose it without limitation or restriction, subject to applicable law. We will not knowingly attempt to reidentify previously anonymized, aggregated, or deidentified information.</p>

</ul>
<p>We will not use Precise Geolocation Information for our own marketing purposes. We may disclose Precise Geolocation Information to companies that provide services integrated with our products, such as satellite radio providers and connected vehicle data services platforms. These disclosures might be considered a sale under certain privacy laws.</p>

<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Security</span></h4>
<p>
We strive to protect Covered Information by using commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards&nbsp;and requiring our service providers to do the same. Even with these safeguards, no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, you provide or authorize collection of Covered Information by us or our service providers at your own risk.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">International Data Processing</span></h4>
<p>
We may store or process Covered Information in the United States and in foreign countries. In some countries, applicable laws may allow the government to more easily demand access to your Covered Information.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="onboarddata"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On-Board Data</span></h4>
<p>
“On-Board Data”, is information that the vehicle collects, generates, records, or stores in electronic form that remains on the vehicle and could be retrieved by a person with access to the vehicle, but which we do not wirelessly retrieve. For example, On-Board Data may include data such as diagnostic information that a dealer’s vehicle service technician or another person can retrieve using a plug-in device or destinations a user programs into the navigation system. On-Board Data is not Covered Information except when transmitted to us, in which case we will treat it as Covered Information. We generally do not receive On-Board Data; however, third parties with physical access to the vehicle, such as service technicians, a person to whom you sell the vehicle, valets, or temporary operators of the vehicle, may be able to retrieve this data. Although not Covered Information, we want to provide you with information about On-Board Data so that you can make informed choices about how to use the vehicle and what access to provide others. </p>
<p>The vehicle may generate and store as On-Board Data same categories of information that are described as Covered Information. Like with Covered Information, you may make certain choices regarding the types of On-Board Data generated or collected by the vehicle: </p>
<ul>
    <li>If<em> </em>you refrain from accessing or using the vehicle navigation system, information about your trip destinations will not be stored in the navigation system<em>.</em></li>
    <li>If<em> </em>you refrain from connecting a smart device to the vehicle, either by wireless or physical connection, the vehicle will not receive (or store) information from the smart device<em>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Management of On-Board Data</span></h4>
<p>
To reduce the amount of On-Board Data stored on the vehicle prior to sale or turning it in at the end of a lease, you should perform a data reset of the audio and navigation systems. Instructions for performing a data reset of the audio and navigation systems may be found in your owner’s manual and/or navigation manual.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="text-center" id="statementregardingevent"><strong>Statement re: Event Data Recorder Operations</strong></p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>Event Data Recorder Disclosure Statement</strong></p>
<p>
While American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (“Honda”) cannot (and therefore does not) retrieve data from an event data recorder without physical access to the vehicle, and thus no such data is transmitted to Honda while a vehicle is in normal use, because there often is confusion about what event data recorders are used for and whether automakers can access the data, Honda believes that it is important to include a copy of the Event Data Recorder Disclosure Statement included in its vehicles’ Owner’s Guides and/or Owner’s Manuals on this webpage. The statement is as follows:</p>
<p>
“This vehicle is equipped with an event data recorder (EDR). The main purpose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near crash-like situations, such as an air bag deployment or hitting a road obstacle, data that will assist in understanding how a vehicle’s systems performed. The EDR is designed to record data related to vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds or less. The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record such data as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;How various systems in your vehicle were operating;</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Whether or not the driver and passenger safety belts were buckled/fastened;</li>
    <li>&nbsp;How far (if at all) the driver was depressing the accelerator and/or brake pedal; and,</li>
    <li>&nbsp;How fast the vehicle was traveling.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstances in which crashes and injuries occur. NOTE: EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a non-trivial crash situation occurs; no data are recorded by the EDR under normal driving conditions and no personal data (e.g., name, gender, age, and crash location) are recorded. However, other parties, such as law enforcement, could combine the EDR data with the type of personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash investigation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed. In addition to the vehicle manufacturer, other parties, such as law enforcement, that have the special equipment, can read the information if they have access to the vehicle or the EDR.” </p>
