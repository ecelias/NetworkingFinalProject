<h1><strong>CS3640 Assignment 4</strong></h1> <br>
<h4><strong>Instructions for running assignment 4</strong></h4> <br>
In order to run this code, make sure you have dpkt, dnspython python-whois, and ipwhois  properly installed. <br>
You can check this by running: <br>
<code>pip install dpkt</code> <br>
<code>pip install dnspython python-whois</code> <br> 
<code>pip install ipwhois</code> <br> <br>
<br> Begin by navigating to to A4 directory. <br> <br>
The virtual environment used to create this code should be stored in the repository and can be activated with: <br>
<code> source ~/cs3640/A4/bin/activate </code> <br>
Remember before running any commands in the terminals for all the code except for the server you need to prepend the command with <code>sudo</code> as you need to run with the administrative privilages to run raw sockets, as send and recieving ICMP packets are generally restricted to elevated permissions. <br>
Also after inputting a sudo command, remember you might have to input your computer password. <br>
For testing cs3640-ping.py: <br>
Open a bash terminal and run the following command: <br>
<code>python3 cs3640-ping.py -destination {IP Address Destination} -n {Number of packets you want to send} -ttl {Time-to-Live for the ICMP packet} <code> <br>
Then, to test cs3640-traceroute run the following command: <br>
<code>python3 cs3640-traceroute.py -destination {IP Address Destinaton} -n_hops {number of hops}</code> <br> 
<br> Finally, to test the intelligence server and client: <br> <br>
(1)Open a bash terminal, and run the following command: 
<code> python cs3640-intelserver.py <code> <br>
(2) open a new bash terminal and run the following command: 
<code> sudo python3 cs3640-intelclient.py -domain {Insert domain to query} -service {The service you want to run} < br>
You can run this command as many times as you want with all different domaians and services through the server. <br> <br>

<code>python3 analyze_perf.py</code> <br> <br>
