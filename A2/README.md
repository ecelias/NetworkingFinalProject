Instructions to run client.py and server.py for assignment 2. <br>
Navigate to the directory containing the server.py and client.py files. <br>
Choose a port number that exceeds 1023. This will be referred to as <PORT_NUM>. <br>
<br>
<br>
In a new terminal window, run: python3 server.py <PORT_NUM>. <br>
For each new client you wish to open, open a new terminal window and run: python3 client.py localhost <PORT_NUM>. <br>
Make sure the port number for all clients you wish to connect to the same server matches the port for the server. <br>
